The earliest extant text of the chanson is a remaniment of the end of the 12th century.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS1">For the history of the chanson de geste see Histoire Litteraire de la France, vol. xxii. pp. 667-700; Renaud de Montauban, edited by H. V. Michelant Stuttgard, 1843; and M. Longnon's paper in Romania, for 1878. The general introduction to this series might also be examined together with M. Gaston Paris' Histoire Poétique de Charlemagne, pp. 19, 139, 298.</NOTE1></P><P>The conversion of the poem into prose was not accomplished before the close of the 14th century.  None of the prose manuscripts are earlier than the 15th century.  Of them the British Museum has three MSS., all in writing of the 15th century.  In one,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS2">Cat. of Romances, Brit. Museum, J. H. Ward, pp. 619-622.</NOTE1> a large vellum folio, about 1445 A.D., the story is illustrated by nine miniatures; in the borders of the first appear the arms of John Talbot, first Earl of Shrewsbury, and those of Henry VI. and his Queen Margaret of Anjou empaled.  It is similar to the usual printed edition, from the third chapter of that edition to the end. Another manuscript, a vellum folio of the 15th century, is also a prose version, to which is prefixed a fragment of a metrical version of the story, the text of which closely resembles that published by Bekker in his Introduction to "Fierbras"; another metrical fragment is added at the conclusion of the prose tale, which contains the adventures of Maugis, how he became Pope under the name of Innocent, hears Charlemagne's confession, and is stifled by the Emperor in a cave near Naples.<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000003" N="vi"/></P><P>The third manuscript at the British Museum contains a much briefer text than that of the printed editions, and is imperfect at the end.</P><P>The French prose rendering of this romance is much inferior to the poem in every sense, and cannot properly be deemed a direct reproduction of it, although it follows the thread of the narrative throughout, sometimes closely enough, at others wandering to a considerable distance; but even while following, it robs the original of half its beauties through its prosaic rendering.  The valuable historical allusions are for the most part cast to the winds, the names abstracted, the circumstances altered, the speeches shortened or omitted, the sequence of the story being frequently unsettled.</P><P>The palm for superior dramatic treatment must also be given to the chanson's version of the chess-murder, on which the mincing of the prose version has a damaging effect.  The toning down of the ferocity of the chanson destroys the prose relation completely as a picture of old time.  The story also can ill afford the omission made in the prose of the curse with which Foulques of Morillon is first introduced—<Q1><L>"En Françe ot i linage cui Dame Dex mal dont;</L><L>Ce fu Grif d'Autefueille et son fil Guenelon,</L><L>Béranger et Hardré et Hervi de Lion,</L><L>Antiaumes li felon, Fouques de Morillon."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS3">Renaus de Montauban, p. 39, ed. Michelant.</NOTE1></L></Q1></P><P>The curse has an important bearing on the events which follow, and gives, in fact, a key to the venom with which Foulques is pursued throughout the story.</P><P>The prose loses much by its rejection of the first embassage of Charlemagne to Beuves d'Aigremont.  The murder of Enguerran, which precedes that of the second ambassador, Lohier, the king's son, lays a far broader basis for the Emperor's revenge, on which the story is built, than the single murder of Lohier in the prose version.</P><P>In connection with this, it may be well to notice the omission of another striking passage from the prose, in which Charlemagne swears vengeance on the murderers of his son and nephew—<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000004" N="vii"/><Q1><L>"Il jure Dame Deu qui tot a à jugier,</L><L>Qu'il ne s'en tornera por Mars ne por Fevrier,</L><L>Tant Kara pris Renaut qu'il ne puet avoir irer;</L><L>As forches iert pendus, nus nel puet respitier.</L><L>Richars sera detrais à keue de somier,</L><L>Ki ocist Loois à l'espée d'acier</L><L>Et Renaus, Bertelai au pesant eschekier," p. 57.</L></Q1></P><P>The circumstance, which we know from history, of Charlemagne having had a son who died young, gives an interest to this passage, which should have pleaded for its preservation, and for that of several others which allude to the same murder.  The exclusion of many such passages of historical interest is a matter of regret.  One passage may be instanced in which mention is made of the monastic foundations of Gerard de Roussillon, to which pious works the name of Doon de Nanteuil is joined with that of his brother.  Of them it says—<Q1><L>"Il des confirent Karle lui et ses compaignons;</L><L>J'en estora saint Pere de Cluigni le baron</L><L>Et puis la charité et vezelai selone,</L><L>Saint Beneoit sor Loire, là où si moine sont," p. 156.</L></Q1></P><P>Of the early printed editions of the French prose romance, which are numerous, the British Museum possesses four, two of Paris and two of Lyons.  One alone of these editions is dated, that of Lyons, 1539.  The general catalogue of the Museum gives as probable dates to the others, 1480, 1520, 1525 respectively.  The edition said to be of Lyons, with the supposed date of 1480 attached to it, is a folio volume whose typography is singularly beautiful.  The letters all stand out distinctly, the type is large, and the words are amply spaced.  Ornamental capitals head the paragraphs throughout.  Caxton's translation of Les Quatre Fils Aymon, which he undertook "at the desire of John Erle of Oxenforde," seems to have been undoubtedly made from this edition, as in portions of the story where these various editions differ from each other, that of the 1480 edition is invariably adopted by Caxton.  In his translation of this work, Caxton shows himself piously literal.  Words and phrases, both foreign and unusual, he transferred bodily to his text; nothing ever deterred him, simply because it was French; he wandered along every winding of the sentences he was rendering, and brought<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000005" N="viii"/> them over with all their sinuosities into the English.  In consequence, his translation is perhaps one of the most literal that has ever been produced in the English language, and though to some extent stilted and even awkward, yet it is impossible not to admire his faithfulness to his original; and the very quaintness of those peculiarities of language sometimes adds a charm to his composition.</P><P>The few instances where Caxton has differed from the French will be seen by the collations which have occasionally been marked in foot-notes on the pages of this work.</P><P>As a picture of the language of the time, his "Four Sons of Aymon" is highly curious and interesting.  He continues the use of double negatives—so common in Chaucer and other Early-English writers.  That this was not merely an imitation from the French, is shown by Caxton making use of two where his original gives him warrant only for one.  On p. 65, l. 24, "Charlemagne made Aymon to swere that he should never gyue no help to his children"; p. 18, l. 10, "for doubte of death shall not leue nothynge unsayd of hys message to the duke benes."  On p. 255, l. 27, "All my lymmes shaken for angre, nor I can not stande upon my feet."  In the French there is but one negative.  Ed. 1480.  Caxton frequently omits the pronominal subject of a verb in the clauses of a sentence, which succeed the leading one, so that often the drift of the narrative alone leaves the reader to decide the subject of the verb thus omitted. This practice with him is generally an imitation of his original.  On p. 238, l. 24, "The frenshemen had wounded hym wyth two speres well depe in to the flesshe and was taken for prysoner."  The French is (Ed. 1480) "et lavoient naure de deux espees bien parfond en la cher et fut prins pour prisonnier."</P><P>Caxton uses many words in the plural which are now allowed only in the singular, this also is usually in obedience to his original. On p. 262, l. 29, "armed with his own armures"; on p. 235, l. 32, "But their corages were never the lesse therfore."  Occasionally a word occurs in the singular where a plural is now used: on p. 182, l. 31, the troops are ordered to come, "well garnysshed of vytaylle for the space of vii. yeres."  The Midland plural in en occurs frequently: on p. 3, l. 16, "virtues which ben digne"; p. 5, l. 2,<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000006" N="ix"/> "chapytres whiche speaken of many faire matters"; p. 13, l. 27, "Bayard is yit a lyve in the forest of Ardeyne as men sayen." The Southern plural in eth also occurs: on p. 70, l. 26, "thise ben the folke of themperour Charlemayn that goeth to Ardeyn."  Sometimes the plural form now used is found in the singular: on p. 75, l. 32, "Themperour Charlemayn of fraunce lete you wyte by us that ye sende to hym Guycharde."</P><P>The possessive case of nouns in Caxton is made, as usual, by the addition of s or es: thus on p. 77, l. 19, "Charlemayn's folke"; p. 13, l. 17, "for goddes sake"; though it is sometimes made in is, p. 25, l. 8, "Bayardis back."  On p. 283, l. 1, there is a singular example, "his face towarde the horse taylle."</P><P>Caxton almost invariably uses ye for the nominative and you for the objective case of the pronoun.  There is an exception on p. 172, l. 31, due possibly to the compositor setting the MS. 'yu' = thou, as 'you':—"I wote not what you sayste thou arte more like a foole than a bysshop."  Also on p. 142, l. 7, "I praye the for the love that you haste to thy god, that thou gyve me trewes."</P><P>Which is constantly used for persons, and so used is generally preceded by the definite article.  That and that that are frequently used instead of what, whose occurrence is rare in comparison with these substitutes: on p. 70, l. 32, "I conne you nother thank nor grace of that that ye saye."  This (= pl. thise) is frequently used for these: on p. 184, l. 20, "I will departe the londe of Gascoyn to this yonge knyghtes for theyr herytage."  Other is invariably used for others, and self for selves: on p. 98, l. 28, "Reynawde mounted upon Bayarde and the other also lighted upon theyr horses."  A very common use in Caxton—as in many other writers—is that of the past participle losing its final n, and assuming an infinitive form after an auxiliary verb.  On p. 3, l. 12, "the clerkes haue had great knowledge by innumerable volumes of bookes which haue be made"; p. 14, l. 3, "Iherusalem was take agayne of the Christen." A great many old or peculiar forms of the past tenses and participles occur: on p. 137, l. 20, "he hewe"; p. 79, l. 11, "flancardes all tobrosten"; p. 176, l. 22, "Euery man putted hymself for to renne." The word conne, to be able, is constantly used; and a similar use is<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000007" N="x"/> made of may, on p. 227, l. 16, "For wyte that yf I telled you not, ye sholde not maye knowe it."  The form mowe of this verb sometimes occurs: on p. 167, l. 25, "ye shall mowe know the beste horse of your royame."  Giving a future auxiliary to the verb will is curious.  On p. 64, l. 21, "il vous rendra au roy" is translated, "he shall wyll yelde you to the kynge."  A striking feature of Caxton's English is the number of reflective verbs with which it abounds. On p. 4, l. 11, "Whyche booke I haue endevorde me to accomplyshe." P. 236, l. 18, "Yet shall I selle me full dere or I deye." An example may be given of verbs completed by prepositions: p. 6, l. 30, "and gaue them of havoyre so much, that they myghte well make war with agenst the king."  Caxton has many substitutes for present participles, which reduces their use considerably, as on p. 70, l. 27, "These ben the folke of themperour that goeth to Ardeyn"; p. 74, l. 32, "sende a messager to Reynawde for to tell hym that he yelde you Guycharde."</P><P>He makes use also of a great many particles needless in modern English, by the omission of many others in places where they are now deemed indispensable.  A few characteristic sentences will illustrate his practice in this respect.  On p. 154, l. 30, "ioye began to be grete in the castell as god had descended there"; p. 87, l. 10, "So he swere god"; p. 109, l. 3, "he was so wery he myghte no more."</P><P>The adverb very had hardly come into use: it has many forerunners, such as full, sore, right, etc.</P><P>Nother is constantly used for neither; sith and syn for the later since.  Ne is sometimes used for nor, in second alternatives, as on p. 317, l. 31, "I saw neuer nether crysten man, nother sarrasyn, soo goodly a prynce, ne soo curteys as ye be one."</P><P>An-angered is an intensitive by which Caxton translates the French 'enragé.'  But yf is another old expression continued by him for unless: on p. 101, l. 9, "it sholde hurte hym sore but yf he myghte take theym."</P><P>The use of doo with the infinitive—'doo make' = cannot be made,—is another continuation by Caxton of an older usage, and is a great contrast to modern English: on p. 18, l. 28, "I shall doo<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000008" N="xi"/> hange"; p. 7, l. 21, "And dyd doo make the castell of Montawban." Sometimes the verb make is substituted for do, in its sense of 'perform,' as on p. 84, l. 4, "the grete fayttes of armes that he made there."</P><P>Caxton makes use largely of articles where they are now omitted, and omits them frequently in places where they are always used, as on p. 6, l. 5, "it bare a great dommage to the realme"; p. 8, l. 32, "Mawgys broughte suche a succourses."</P><P>The order of words in sentences is frequently changed in Caxton's text, as in earlier English: on p. 87, l. 18, Reynawde "wente to chasse in woodes &amp; in ryvers as often as hym playsed" = it pleased him; on p. 117, l. 23, "euerybody had of it pyte."</P><P>The original edition of Caxton's "Four Sons of Aymon" has neither title-page, printer's name, place, nor date.  It is a folio volume, and the fortunate possessor of the only copy known is Earl Spencer.  The celebrated founder of the Althorp Library, Earl George, acquired it by purchase in the year 1822.  Of its previous history we can discover nothing.  The date assigned to it by Blades, in his life of Caxton, is 1489, and has been adopted from the circumstance, that the works issued from Caxton's fount No. 6 range from 1489 to 1493.  Although Earl Spencer's copy is unique, it is not perfect.  It lacks Caxton's prologue and colophon.  To its owner I return the warm thanks of the Society and myself for generously sending his treasure to the British Museum for so many months for our use.  The General Catalogue of the British Museum mistakingly represents that institution as the possessor of two leaves of another copy of Caxton's "Four Sons of Aymon."  Unfortunately, however, there is really only one leaf, for the second is apparently an extract from some work of devotion or popular theology, and though resembling in both type and style the leaf to which it is attached by the compiler of the Catalogue, has no connection with it.  The genuine leaf is the beginning of chapter xxv, and is similar to the corresponding leaf in Copland's edition.  Even the vignette which heads the leaf is the same, and is a repetition from the block used for chapter ix.  Four leaves of the same edition were discovered by Mr. Blades to be in the possession of Mr. Green of Bishops Stortford<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000009" N="xii"/> in 1882.  They are portions of signature E, and do not therefore supply the defects of the Althorp copy.</P><P>A second edition, as we learn from the colophon of the third edition, was "Imprinted at London by Wynken de Worde, the viii. daye of Maye, and the yere of our lorde. M.cccc.iiii."  One leaf only of this edition is known to be extant.  It was discovered in 1882 in a volume of early-printed fragments by Mr. Henry Bradshaw, and is now in the Cambridge University Library.</P><P>Copland's third edition was issued on 6th May 1554; the colophon describes it as printed for Thomas Petit, not for Robert Toye, as asserted by the Catalogue of the Harleian Library.  It was no doubt printed for both these and other booksellers, as the 'trade' editions of Chaucer were.  The prologue to this edition is undoubtedly a literal reprint of Caxton's original preface, and it thus supplies one of the chief defects of the Althorpe copy.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS4">For the bibliography of the romance, see two letters by Mr. W. Blades, and one by Mr. S. L. Lee, Athenæum, Aug. 19, 26, and Sept. 9, 1882.</NOTE1>  Although no edition later than Copland's is now known, entries in the Stationers' Registers point to the conclusion that the romance was twice reprinted before the close of the century.  Licences to reissue it were granted in March 1582 (Arber's Transcript, ii. 408), and in February 1598-9 (ibid. iii. 137).  On 22nd Feb. 1598-9 a printer was licensed to print "the last part of the ffowre sons of Aymon" (ibid. iii. 139).<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS5">In Arber's Transcript, iv. 459, is an assignment of 'The four sonns of Aymon' by Wm. Stansby, and his widow Elizabeth after his death, to Master Bishop, on 4 March, 1639.</NOTE1></P><P>The success of the story of the Sons of Aymon gave birth to many and various editions.  The name and adventures of Renaud were a passport to success of which poets availed themselves, and on all sides there are testimonies to the universal fame of Bayard.  His namesake, "sans peur et sans reproche," is said when besieged in Mezières, recalling the feats of the noble steed through the identity of their names, to have answered the summons to surrender, sent him by Prince Henry of Nassau, with the proud reply, "A Bayard of France will never yield to a cart-stallion of Germany."  The noble Bayard carried the Sons of Aymon everywhere, and all lands were eager to possess them and offer them a home.  Horse and riders were depicted upon the walls of castles and convents.  "On<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000010" N="xiii"/> the walls," says Roquefort, "of the nunnery of St. Reynold in Cologne, is a painting of four Paladins, mounted upon Bayard, and Reynold is distinguished among them by an aureole, the sign of saintship."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS6">Poésie Françoise dans les xij.th et xiiith Siècles, p. 141. Roquefort.</NOTE1></P><P>It is well known that the mediæval romance of France became the property of cultivated Europe.  From its source was supplied the fuel of the worldly imagination, and Renaud taking a prominent part was translated universally, and imitated in all fashions.  In the 13th century Maerland could speak of having read the history of the Four Sons of Aymon in his native Flemish, "Hiemskindre, dat ic las."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS7">Reiffenberg, Philippe Mouskes, vol. ii. ccxiv.</NOTE1>  This translation is said to be due to Nicholas Vesboschten, and it became the source of a German translation of the 13th century.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS8">Hist. poet. de Charl., G. Paris, p. 139.</NOTE1></P><P>Through what channel the story of the Sons of Aymon found passage to Iceland is uncertain.  It is still a question whether the Icelandic versions originated from French manuscripts brought into Norway, which were read by the Scandinavian reciters, or whether they were learnt in France and brought over orally.  The numerous manuscript copies testify to its popularity, the oldest of which may be referred to the middle of the 13th century.  Here the story has acquired a new name.  The Saga of Earl Magus adopts altogether a strange character, it knows nothing at all of the sojourn of the Sons of Aymon in Mountauban, mingles the story with that of Gerard, in whom some recognize the hero of Vienne, brings Charlemagne to live at Worms, and makes the chateau of Aymon Buslaraborg in Germany, giving that of Strasburg to Magus.  The Saga was published for popular reading at Reikavick in 1858.</P><P>In Italy Renaud shone as the hero of every style of poetry, whether chivalrous, amorous, or comic.  The "Quatre Fils d'Aymon" formed one of the volumes of the 13th century "Reali di Francia." Renaud is one of Pulci's heroes; in Boiardo the Emperor Gradasse is obliged to raise 150,000 men to conquer Bayard; and Renaud, side by side with Roland, divides the honours of the famous<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000011" N="xiv"/> "Orlando Innamorata" of Ariosto.  Tasso's "Rinaldo" is based immediately on the French romance of the Four Sons.</P><P>Outside the world of letters altogether, the story has left its trace in the popular traditions of certain portions of France, Belgium, and Germany, chiefly in the neighbourhood of the Ardennes.  The name of the Four Sons of Aymon still clings tenaciously to the ruins of the rock-built Chateau of Ambleve, as does that of Bayard to a chateau at Dhuy.  The whole North of France is associated with the story, and the neighing of Bayard is still believed to be distinctly heard through the valleys of the Ardennes.  In the beginning of the 18th century the presses of Troyes found full employment in its reproduction.  To this day Chateau-Renaud, surrounded by the waters of the Meuse, is still believed to be the neighbourhood of the retreat of Maugis and Bayard, and the Castle of Renout's Steen, in the Province of Liege, is freely abandoned to them in the surrounding universe of popular tradition.  In Brittany, a rude dramatization of the original Epic witnesses to the popularity of the story at the present day.  During the celebration of the Kermesse, a Belgium popular feast, which is said to date back to the year 891, an enormous horse bearing four knights, and decorated with their escutcheons, paraded the streets of Louvain in 1490, behind the corps of the University.  "As late as the year 1825," says Reiffenberg, "Bayard repaired to Mechlin, to crown a feast framed on the oldest models which was held there; and at Dortmund, in Westphalia, Renaud is still held in heroic and saintly esteem."  M. Léon Gautier also calls our attention to the pictures decorating the chimneys of the peasant in France, where, by the side of rude representations of the battle of Austerlitz and the Wandering Jew, is seen that of the Four Sons of Aymon.</P><P>Proofs of the popularity of the English translation of the romance are not far to seek.  We know not only (as we have shown) that reprints of it were numerous, but that the reprints were widely read and appreciated during the later years of the 16th century. The book is one of those which Cox, the Quixotic old captain of Coventry, who took prominent part in the Kenilworth festivities of 1575, had at his fingers' end.  Francis Meres, in the Palladis<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000012" N="xv"/> Tamia, 1598 (p. 268b), mentions the work among others as "no lesse hurtfull to youth then the workes of Machiavell to age." Wherever, in fact, in Elizabethan literature romances are under discussion, the "Four Sons of Aymon" is brought into court, and receives some sort of tribute to its popularity.  The least equivocal of its commendations is the mention in "Henslowe's Diary" of the fact that the story was dramatized, and arrangements made for its production on the stage at the time that Shakespeare and his companions were proving the potentialities of the English drama.  The entries in the theatrical manager's diary runs as follows:—<Q1><P>"Layd owt for the componye, the 10 of desembr 1602 unto Robarte Shawe for a boocke of the 4 sonnes of Amon the some of . . . . . xls."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS9">p. 230.</NOTE1></P></Q1><Q1><P>"Memorandum that I Robert Shaa have receaued of Mr. Phillip Henshlowe the some of forty shellinges upon a booke called the fower sonnes of Aymon, which booke, if it be not played by the Company of the Fortune nor noe other company by my leaue, I doe then bynd my selfe by theis presentes to repay the sayd some of forty shillinges upon the delivery of my booke att Christmas next, which shall be in the yeare of our Lord God 1603 and in the xlvjth yeare of the Raigne of the Queene.  per me  ROBT.

It does not appear that the play was published.</P><P>Thomas Heywood, in his Apology for Actors, 1612 (repr. in Somers' Tracts (1810), iii. 574-600), the Third Booke, argues that, among the benefits of plays, they "haue beene the discouerers of many notorious murders, long concealed from the eyes of the world" (sign. G, bk.; Somers, iii. 598).  And after citing an instance of this 'at Lin in Norfolke,' and another of marauding Spaniards at 'a place called Perin [i. e. Penryn] in Cornwall,' being frightened into flight by a battle on the stage, he goes on with the following<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000013" N="xvi"/> case of the play of the Four Sons of Aymon and Renaud's murder (sign. G 2; Somers, iii. 599).<Q1><P>"Another of the like wonder happened at Amsterdam in Holland: A company of our English Comedians (well knowne) trauelling those Countreyes, as they were before the Burghers, and other the chiefe inhabitants, acting the last part of the 4 sons of Aymon, towards the last act of the history, where penitent Renaldo, like a common labourer, liued in disguise, vowing, as his last pennance, to labour &amp; carry burdens to the structure of a goodly Church there to be erected, whose diligence the labourers enuying, since, by reason of his stature and strength, hee did vsually perfect more worke in a day, then a dozen of the best, (hee working for his conscience, they for their lucres,) wherevpon, by reason his industry had so much disparaged their liuing, conspired amongst themselues to kill him, waiting some opportunity to finde him asleepe, which they might easily doe, since the sorest labourers are the soundest sleepers, and industry is the best preparatiue to rest.  Hauing spy'd their opportunity, they droue a naile into his temples, of which wound immediately he dyed.</P><P>"As the Actors handled this, the audience might on a sodaine vnderstand an out-cry and loud shrike in a remote gallery; and pressing about the place, they might perceiue a woman of great grauity, strangely amazed, who, with a distracted &amp; troubled braine, oft sighed out these words: 'Oh, my husband, my husband!'  The play without further interruption proceeded; the woman was to her owne house conducted, without any apparent suspition, euery one coniecturing as their fancies led them.  In this agony shee some few daies languished; and on a time, as certaine of her well-disposed neighbours came to comfort her, one amongst the rest being Churchwarden, to him the Sexton posts, to tell him of a strange thing happening him in the ripping vp of a graue: 'See here (quoth he) what I haue found!' and shewes them a faire skull, with a great nayle pierst quite through the braine-pan; 'but we cannot coniecture to whom it should belong, nor how long it hath laine in the earth, the graue being confused, and the flesh consumed.'  At the report of this accident, the woman, out of the trouble of her afflicted conscience, discouered a former murder.  For 12 years ago, by driuing that nayle into that skull, being the head of her husband, she had trecherously slaine him.  This being publickly confest, she was arraigned, condemned, adiudged, and burned.</P><P>"But I draw my subiect to greater length then I purposed: these, therefore, out of other infinites, I haue collected both for their familiarnesse and latenesse of memory."</P></Q1></P></DIV1><DIV1 NODE="AHA2639:2" TYPE="synopsis"><EPB/><PB SEQ="00000014" N="xvii"/><HEAD>SKETCH OF THE STORY.</HEAD><P>THE story opens with an account of the Court of Charlemagne at Paris, where nearly all the powerful Barons of the land are assembled, and among them the Duke Aymon of Dordon, with his four sons, Renaud, Alard, Guichard, and Richard.  Duke Beuves of Aigremont, brother to Aymon, is absent from the court, and the Emperor is so enraged by this insult, that he vows to besiege Aigremont, unless Beuves promises to serve him next summer with a powerful army. Duke Naymes advises Charlemagne to send a messenger to Aigremont, and after some discussion, Lohier, the eldest son of the Emperor, is sent there with a hundred knights.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS11">In the original chanson Enguerrand, the nephew of the Emperor, is first sent to Aigremont, he is slain, and Lohier then undertakes the message and shares the same fate.  A knight called Enquerrard of Peronne is killed at Troyes by Beuves in this prose version.</NOTE1>  He delivers his message insolently to Duke Beuves, who answers him with equal warmth, and a fight ensues, in which Lohier is slain by Duke Beuves; his body is conveyed to Charlemagne by the few survivors of his company and buried at Saint-Germain.  The Emperor vows to revenge the death of his son by besieging Aigremont.</P><P>Meanwhile the Sons of Aymon have been created knights by Charlemagne, and Renaud has been presented with the wonderful horse Bayard.</P><P>When Aymon hears of the death of Lohier, he departs with his sons in haste to Dordon for fear of the Emperor's wrath.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS12">In the chanson Aymon is banished by Charlemagne before the death of Lohier, and is received again into favour when the preparations for the attack on Aigremont are being carried out; his sons are then created knights.</NOTE1>  Great preparations are made at Paris for the campaign against Duke Beuves; while the army are on their way to Aigremont, a messenger informs them that Beuves is at Troyes, and is besieging that city with the assistance of his brothers, Doon of Nantueil and Gerard of<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000015" N="xviii"/> Roussillon;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS13">This includes Aymon in the chanson, but no mention is made of his being present at the siege of Troyes in the prose version; he is supposed to be still at Dordon until after the death of Beuves.</NOTE1> the inhabitants therefore implore the help of Charlemagne.</P><P>The fact of Beuves having summoned his brother Gerard of Roussillon to Aigremont, in order to march upon Troyes, has enlightened us as to the situation of Aigremont.  M. Paris says:<Q1><P>"Le château Roussillon devait être plus éloigné de Troyes que l'autre, puisque c'est le duc Girart qui va trouver son frère pour marcher d'Aigremont sur Troyes.....  La situation d'un village voisin de Chablis en Bourgoyne, encore aujourd'hui nommé Aigremont, semble répondre aux indices que nous offre le texte des deux (romances) de Girart et des quatre fils Aimon."</P></Q1></P><P>The French army arrives at Troyes, where a battle takes place, and lasts until sundown; the armies then cease fighting, neither side having gained the victory.  Next day Beuves and his chief Barons appear barefoot before the Emperor, and crave his pardon; which having been granted to them, peace is proclaimed.</P><P>Beuves promises to serve the Emperor at Paris on the feast of St. John next summer.  On the way thither he is treacherously slain by Earl Guenes, who has obtained Charlemagne's permission to murder him.</P><P>At the next assembly of the Barons at Paris, Aymon and his four sons appear again.</P><P>Renaud plays chess with Bertholais, the nephew of Charlemagne, in the palace; they quarrel over the game, and Renaud, seizing the chess-board, deals Bertholais a blow with it which causes his death.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS14">This incident is differently related in the chanson.  Renaud and Bertholais quarrel during their game of chess, and Bertholais strikes Renaud, who complains of this insult to the Emperor.  Charlemagne takes his nephew's part, which causes Renaud to reply wrathfully to the Emperor, accusing him of the murder of his uncle, Duke Beuves.  Charlemagne then deals Renaud a blow; the latter retires, meets Bertholais, and slays him with the chess-board.  This scene seems to be an imitation of the death of Baldwin (a son of Ogier), who is killed by Charlot (Charlemagne's son) with a chess-board, in the chanson of "Ogier le Danois."</NOTE1> A great tumult thereupon arises in the palace, and the sons escape with much difficulty to Dordon, where they are received by their mother.  They are soon obliged to quit Dordon for fear of the<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000016" N="xix"/> Emperor's wrath and take refuge in the forest of Ardennes, where they build a castle, called Mountaynford (Montessor), and conceal themselves for several years.  M. Paris says:<Q1><P>"Il existe encore au-dessus de Sedan et de Mezières un village nommé Château-Renaud situé sur le penchant d'une haute montagne enfermée par les eaux de la Meuse vers le midi l'est et l'ouest.  On distingue aujourd'hui difficlement sur la roche quelques ruines d'une forteresse, mais ces ruines avaient, il y a deux ans, plus de caractère, quand Malherbe notre grand poëte écrivait au savant antiquaire Peiresc.  'La principauté de Madame la princesse de Conti s'appelle Chasteau-Renaud, à deux lieues de Sedan et autant ruiné, ou l'on voit encore la tour de Maugis et l'estable de Bayard.'"</P></Q1></P><P>Charlemagne, as soon as he hears of the Sons' retreat, collects an army and besieges the castle;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS15">No mention is made here of the Espans pass, supposed to be inhabited by fairies.  In the chanson Charlemagne warns his men against the dangers they may encounter in this ravine.</NOTE1> the old Duke Aymon fights against his children, as he has sworn to defend the Emperor's cause.  Terms of peace are offered to Renaud if he will deliver up his brother Guichard, which he indignantly refuses to accept.  The three gates of the castle are then surrounded by the Frenchmen, but this does not prevent the Sons from hunting daily in the forest.  After the siege has lasted 14 months, Hernyer of Seveyne<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS16">Hernyer of Lausanne; he is promised the town of Laon as well as the castle.  The Espans pass is again alluded to when the Sons are chased from Montfort in the chanson.</NOTE1> promises to take Renaud and his brother's prisoners, if Charlemage will give him the castle as a reward.  He then approaches the castle and begs Renaud to grant him shelter as an enemy of the Emperor's; Renaud believes his story, and allows him to sleep in the castle; when all have retired to rest, Hernyer lets down the drawbridge and signals to his men to enter.  Fortunately for the Sons, Alard's horse wakes Renaud, who rouses his brothers, and they fight their enemies valiantly; Charlemagne sets a portion of the castle on fire; in the tumult Hernyer and his followers are slain by Renaud, who afterwards escapes on Bayard with his brothers into the Forest of Ardennes.  They are pursued for some distance, but their enemies cannot overtake them. Duke Naymes advises Charlemagne to give up the campaign and disband his army.  This being done the Emperor returns to Paris.</P><P><EPB/><PB SEQ="00000017" N="xx"/>Aymon on his way to Dordon, meets his Sons encamping in the Forest, when Renaud begs him to grant them peace, but Aymon only reproaches him for his conduct; they fight, and lose heavily on both sides, and the Sons with but 14 of their men are only saved by crossing a small river.</P><P>Aymon departs for Paris, taking with him the body of Esmenroi, a favourite knight of Charlemagne's, who has been slain by Renaud. He gives the Emperor a full account of the battle, but he is not believed to have fought against his sons, and is received coldly by Charlemagne; he therefore leaves Paris and arrives at Dordon, where the Duchess blames him severely for his conduct towards his children.</P><P>Renaud and his brothers wander in the forest until they are nearly famished, and all their horses die, except Bayard, who thrives on roots; at last they determine to go to Dordon and entreat their mother to receive them.  They are not recognised in the streets of the city as they pass through, and even their mother does not know who they are at first; but she discovers Renaud by a scar on his face, and welcomes them joyfully.  They sit down to supper,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS17">In the chanson the four brothers enter the palace and sit down to supper before their mother recognises them.</NOTE1> and while they are relating their adventures, Aymon enters the castle. He is furious with his Sons at first, but soon afterwards repents of his conduct towards them, and allows the Duchess to give them food and money; nevertheless, he will not break his promise to Charlemagne, so he retires into the forest while his Sons inhabit the palace.</P><P>Next day they depart from Dordon, and on their way meet Maugis returning from the Court of Charlemagne, where he has managed to steal a quantity of gold, which he divides with Renaud and joins their company.</P><P>They journey towards Bordeaux, and from the description of the journey it is possible to determine the situation of Dordon, which is, as M. Paris says:<Q1><P>"La ville actuelle de Dourdon effectivement située dans cette partie de la Brie Française nommée le Hurepois, et d'où l'on doit passer dans le Gâtinais puis dans l'Orléanais, pour se rendre en Aquitaine."</P></Q1></P><P><EPB/><PB SEQ="00000018" N="xxi"/>On arriving at Bordeaux they offer their services to King John of Gascony, who is at war with the Saracen King Bege (Borgons); John willingly accepts their aid, and Renaud conducts the war so successfully, that Bege is taken prisoner and peace proclaimed. Renaud is then allowed to build the Castle of Montauban, and is soon afterwards married to King John's sister Clare; the wedding being solemnised with great ceremony at Montauban.</P><P>The Emperor on his way to Gallicia passes Bordeaux, he looks over the river Garonne, and marvels at the beauty and strength of the castle newly built there.  On discovering that it belongs to Renaud, he sends Ogier to demand the four sons from John; when this request is refused, Charlemagne wishes to besiege the castle, but his Barons demur, as they are tired of war.  At this juncture Roland<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS18">When Roland arrives at the Emperor's palace, he tells Charlemagne, "I am called Rowland of bretagne, and I am the sone of your suster and of the duke Myllon."  These words accord with the history which makes Roland governor "des marches de Bretagne."</NOTE1> arrives, and undertakes a campaign against the Saracens<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS19">Saxons in the chanson.</NOTE1> on his uncle Charlemagne's behalf.  He besieges Cologne, takes the Saracen chief prisoner, and returns to the Emperor.</P><P>All Roland now requires is a good horse; for this reason Charlemagne proclaims a horse-race at Paris, and the best steed is to be bought for Roland.  Renaud determines to race Bayard, so he and Maugis set out for their journey to Paris.  Maugis, in order that they may not be recognised, changes Bayard from a black into a white horse, and makes Renaud look like a boy of fifteen.</P><P>Four miles outside Paris they meet Ogier and Naymes, whom the Emperor has sent to guard the way; the Barons, however, do not recognise them, and allow them to proceed.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS20">This incident is omitted in the chanson.</NOTE1>  They arrive at Paris, and lodge in a shoemaker's house; but from some hints dropped by Renaud, the man discovers their secret, and vows to inform the Emperor, whereupon he is instantly slain by Renaud, who escapes with Maugis from the house.  Bayard has his feet tied by Maugis, in order that he may appear to be lame until after the other horses have started, when he is unbound, and wins the race<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000019" N="xxii"/> easily.  Renaud seizes Charlemagne's crown, which is exhibited as a prize, and telling the Emperor that he may look elsewhere for a horse for Roland, rides hastily from the city, and swimming over the river Seine, joins Maugis.  They arrive at Melun, where they meet the other three Sons, and ride through Orleans to Montauban.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS21">In the chanson Renaud joins Maugis at Champeaux, they reach Monthery, and then journey through Poitiers and Orleans to Montauban.</NOTE1></P><P>The Emperor, determined to be revenged upon Renaud,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS22">It is on the Emperor's return from an expedition against the Saxons, where he has killed the chief Guitechim, that he collects an army to besiege Montauban in the chanson.  This incident is omitted in the prose version.</NOTE1> assembles a mighty army at Paris, during Eastertide, and marches towards the Castle of Montauban,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS23">In the chanson Charlemagne marches first to Montbendel, which he surrounds with his immense army: he admires the strength of the castle, which, he says, is finer than Roche Guyon, Paris, or Orleans; "that is nothing," says Ogier, "Montauban is a hundred times stronger."  Charlemagne subdues the Castle of Montbendel, he hopes to conquer all Gascony in the same manner without bloodshed.  The siege is then directed towards Montauban.</NOTE1> where they encamp.  Roland and Oliver pitch their tent at Balencon, near the river, and go hawking one day, thinking they may leave the camp in safety, but Renaud discovers their absence, goes forth against Charlemagne's army, which he surprises, and finally, having captured the golden dragon from Roland's tent, returns to his castle with much plunder.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS24">This incident is not mentioned in the chanson.</NOTE1></P><P>The Emperor, in despair of ever taking the castle, despatches a messenger<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS25">The name of Girard the Spaniard, who advises Charlemagne to demand the surrender of the Sons, and of Gainemark, who undertakes the message, are mentioned in the chanson.  When the messenger arrives, King John attempts to strike him, threatening to have him hung; his barons interfere.  John then consents to consider Charlemagne's proposals, and keeps the messenger three days for his answer.  This incident is very differently related in the prose version, where John receives the herald courteously, and tells him, "ye must tari here a seven night" for his answer.</NOTE1> to ask King John to deliver up to him the four Sons; after a long discussion with his Barons<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS26">Among the Barons who argue with John for the deliverance of the Sons to Charlemagne is the Lord of Montbendel, who in speech mentions the surrender of his castle, referring to that portion of the siege by Charlemagne which is omitted in the prose version.</NOTE1> John consents to betray them, which he does by sending them unarmed to the plain of Vaucouleurs, where the Barons of Charlemagne await to take them prisoners.  The Sons discover the treachery of King John when they<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000020" N="xxiii"/> arrive at Vaucouleurs, but they nevertheless fight bravely against an enormous host of adversaries, and finally gain a respite through the kindness of Ogier.  Meanwhile Maugis, who is at Montauban, hears from King John's secretary of the plot against his cousins, and sets off for Vaucouleurs, where he arrives in time to rescue them.  King John on receiving the news of their rescue, flies to an abbey in the wood of the Serpent, where he seeks refuge for a time, but is discovered by Roland, who takes him prisoner.  John, in terror of his life, contrives to send a messenger to Renaud, who is now at Montauban, beseeching him to come to his assistance.  Renaud and his brothers ride forth to meet Roland, and a battle ensues, in which Renaud is victorious, and rescues King John, but Richard remains a prisoner in the hands of Roland.  Maugis, in order to save Richard from the cruelty of Charlemagne, departs for the Emperor's tent disguised as a poor pilgrim, and arrives before Roland has returned with Richard.  Maugis completely deceives the Emperor, who orders food to be given to him as a holy man.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS27">When Maugis appears before the Emperor, and craves for food, he asks Charlemagne to put it in his mouth, as a dream has led him to believe that thereby he will be saved from all his sufferings.  Charlemagne consents to this; no mention is made of the palmer's staff in the chanson.</NOTE1>  Roland then enters the tent, and presents Richard to Charlemagne, who declares that he shall be hung without delay.  Richard recognises Maugis, and is therefore certain of escape from the hands of the Emperor.  Maugis then leaves the tent, and retires hastily to Montauban; he orders Renaud and his two brothers to arm themselves and with an army to proceed to the tent of Charlemagne.</P><P>Renaud willingly consents, and proceeds to Monfaucon with his folk, where they encamp in a wood near the gallows which are being prepared for Richard, but unfortunately they fall asleep from extreme weariness.  Meanwhile Charlemagne commands the execution of Richard, and orders several of his Barons to perform the deed, but they all refuse on various pretexts, until Ripus of Riplemond undertakes the duty.  Richard is led before the gallows, and believing that there is no chance of escape for him, begs for time in which to pray, and confesses to a priest.  Just as he has finished his confession, and is prepared for death, his brothers (who have been<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000021" N="xxiv"/> awakened by the sagacious Bayard) appear, and a fight ensues, in which Ripus is killed by Renaud, who gives his armour to Richard; the latter, with four hundred men, presents himself before Ogier, who is rejoiced over the victory of the Sons.  Richard afterwards meets Charlemagne, they fight, Renaud and his men join in the battle, and after a prolonged skirmish, the Sons enter the Emperor's pavilion with three thousand men, and bear away the golden eagle, which Renaud conveys to Montauban.  Maugis is left alone with the Emperor's army, and fights bravely for his liberty, but is over-powered by Oliver, who presents him to Charlemagne, just as the latter is complaining of his subjects' infidelity to him in allowing the Sons of Aymon to escape.  The Emperor vows to slay Maugis without delay.  The Sons meanwhile have returned to Montauban, where they discover the absence of their cousin.  Renaud, in great anxiety for his fate, mounts Bayard, and goes to the river Balencon; he meets there two pages from the Emperor's camp, who tell him that Maugis is in Charlemagne's hands.  Renaud vows to rescue him next day.</P><P>The Emperor commands his Barons to prepare a gallows on which to hang Maugis; but Naymes begs him to delay the execution until the following day, and Charlemagne consents to this, on condition that Maugis will promise not to escape.  The twelve peers give their pledges for his safety, and prepare to watch over him all night; but Maugis, who has been put in irons, nevertheless contrives to charm all his guardians to sleep, and then departs, taking with him the Emperor's sword, and those of Roland and Oliver, with much treasure to Montauban.  On the way thither he meets Renaud at the river-side of Balencon, and the cousins journey together to the castle, where much feasting and rejoicing takes place.  Richard shows Maugis the golden eagle which they have captured, and it is set up on the high tower of the castle.  Naymes and Ogier are sent to Montauban by Charlemagne to demand the surrender of his sword, in return for which a truce shall be granted them for two years. Renaud consents to these conditions, and, moreover, goes back with the Barons to the Emperor's camp.  He is conducted before Charlemagne, who vows he shall be slain, but a compromise is effected, in<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000022" N="xxv"/> which Renaud and Roland are doomed to fight a duel on the morrow. At Monfaucon the battle begins, but the final contest between the heroes is prevented by the appearance of a miraculous cloud, and Roland goes with Renaud to Montauban as his prisoner.</P><P>Charlemagne besieges the castle, but in the night Maugis, through the medium of a charm, carries the Emperor asleep to Montauban; he then leaves the castle, and goes over the river Dordogne into a hermitage, where he lives poorly, doing penance for his sins.  The Sons discover the presence of the Emperor in Montauban still asleep, they search for Maugis, but are bitterly afflicted when they hear he has left them.  Charlemagne will not consent to peace unless Maugis is given up to him, but Renaud allows him to return to his tent unharmed with the Barons.  Charlemagne, vowing he will starve the Sons into submission, has the castle surrounded by his men, and although Renaud several times repulses the enemy, he can gain no advantage over them.  Great famine prevails in Montauban, and all the horses, except Bayard, are slain for food.  Renaud, as a last resource, goes to the tent of Duke Aymon and implores him to give his starving children food.  Aymon finally consents, and sends provisions into the castle by means of the engines used in the assaults on Montauban, which he fills with food instead of stones.  The Emperor discovers that Aymon has been befriending his children, and dismisses him from his army for this offence.</P><P>The Sons are again reduced to starvation, but are finally saved by an old man in the castle, who shows Renaud a secret passage from Montauban into the wood of the Serpent.  All the people abandon the castle and go to the monastery, where Renaud's friend Bernard dwells; and after obtaining food and wine from him they depart for Arden (or Dordon, in the French prose version), where they are joyfully received by the people of the town.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS28">In the chanson the Sons are said to go to Tremogne, not Arden or Dordon.  This Tremogne is the ancient name for Dortmund in Westphalia, which position would account for the fact that Charlemagne passes Liege to go to Paris; from Dordon this would be impossible.</NOTE1></P><P>Charlemagne quickly discovers the flight of the Sons from Montauban and the secret passage; he immediately orders his army to besiege Arden (Dordon).  As they hasten towards the castle, Renaud<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000023" N="xxvi"/> perceives their approach, and at once orders a number of his knights to arm and accompany him in his attack upon the Emperor.  Renaud and his army are obliged, however, to retreat after a fierce skirmish with the enemy; and having captured Duke Richard of Normandy, they take him prisoner into the castle.  The Peers all implore Charlemagne to make peace with the Sons for fear they should slay Duke Richard; but the Emperor is still persistent in his refusal. King John at this time dies in the castle.  Maugis within his hermitage has a dream of the distress of his kinsmen, and he sets forth towards Arden.  On the way he encounters two merchants, who have been robbed by thieves in the wood; Maugis slays the robbers and gives back the plunder to the merchants, and he hears from them of the condition of the Sons, and hastens towards their castle, which he enters in the guise of a pilgrim, and is served with food as a stranger.  Renaud towards night recognises him, and great joy is made over his arrival.  Next day he departs for the Holy Land.  R naud causes a gallows to be erected on the walls of his castle, in order to hang Duke Richard; seeing this Charlemagne is persuaded by his Barons to send Duke Naymes to the castle with terms of peace; the conditions being that Renaud should give up Bayard to the Emperor and depart to the Holy Land in poor array, begging his bread as a pilgrim, while his brothers keep all his lands during his absence.  Renaud accepts these conditions, and after clothing himself poorly and commending his wife and children to the protection of Duke Richard, departs from his castle.  Charlemagne takes possession of Bayard, and on his way to Paris stays at Liege, where he orders the horse to be thrown into the river Meuse, with a millstone round his neck.  This command is carried out, but Bayard contrives to break the stone, and swimming to land, gallops away unharmed into the forest of Ardennes.</P><P>Renaud arrives at Constantinople and lodges with a holy woman, who tells him there is another pilgrim in the house lying sick; Renaud goes to see the pilgrim, and finds his cousin Maugis.  They meet joyfully, and after feasting together set forth for Jerusalem. They find a largo army surrounding the Holy City; on inquiring the cause of this, they are told that the Admiral of Persia has taken the<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000024" N="xxvii"/> city by treason, and it is being besieged by the Christians.  Renaud and Maugis pass through the Christian encampment, and set up a small tent for themselves.  Next morning the enemy advances towards their tent, which in the confusion of battle is overthrown. Renaud<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS29">In the chanson Renaud mounts a mule and pnrsues the enemy, while Maugis showers stones upon the Saracens.</NOTE1> mounts a wall near by, and with a large fork or tent pole defends the way, and assisted by Maugis, slays numbers of the enemy. Earl Rames<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS30">Geffroi, orig.</NOTE1> approaches the two pilgrims, and on learning their history welcomes them with delight; he provides them with rich clothing and armour, giving the command of his army to Renaud. King Thomas,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS31">No mention is made of King Thomas in the chanson; Geffroi of Nazareth is in command of the Christian army, and is subsequently made King of Jerusalem at the conclusion of the war.  When Renaud enters Jerusalem he goes straight to the Holy Sepulchre, where he and Maugis offer their devotions.</NOTE1> who is a prisoner within Jerusalem, wonders why so much feasting and rejoicing is taking place amidst his army.  Next day the Admiral renews his attack on the Christians, the Saracen King Margary is slain by Renaud, and after a fierce battle the Saracens are discomfited, and fly towards the city pursued by Earl Rames.  Renaud contrives by placing a large beam under the portcullis to keep open the gate into Jerusalem, and the Christian army enters and takes possession of the city.  The Admiral vows to slay King Thomas unless Renaud will grant him terms of peace, and allow of his safe conduct back to Persia; to these conditions Renaud consents, and peace is concluded amidst general rejoicings. King Thomas prepares a ship, which he fits out for Renaud and Maugis, in order that they may return to France.  After eight months at sea they arrive at Palermo.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS32">In the chanson this incident of Renaud's encounter with the Persian Admiral is entirely omitted.  They take ship at Acre and go straight to Brindisi, whence Renaud journeys to France, and arrives at Tremogne (Dortmund) in Westphalia.  Maugis retires to his hermitage.</NOTE1>  King Simon of that town receives them gladly, and tells them how his lands are daily wasted by the Persian Admiral.  Renaud and Maugis vow to assist him against his enemy.  They encounter the Admiral and rout his forces, compelling him to retire utterly discomfited.  Soon after this Renaud and Maugis take leave of King Simon and journey by sea to Rome,<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000025" N="xxviii"/> where they confess to the Pope, and having received his benediction depart for France.  They are joyfully received at Arden by the three brothers, and from them Renaud hears of the death of his wife Clarisse.  He takes his two children and Maugis to Montalban, where the people of that town welcome them gladly.  Maugis then takes leave of Renaud and departs for his hermitage, where thirteen years afterwards he dies.  Renaud prepares his two sons for their journey to Paris to be presented to Charlemagne, and sends them to the Court with an escort of five hundred knights.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS33">In the chanson Renaud accompanies his sons to Paris.</NOTE1>  They arrive there, and are graciously received by Charlemagne, who confers on them the honour of knighthood, and raises them to the post of carvers at his table.  This rouses the jealousy of Constant and Rohart, the two sons of Foulques, whose father was slain at Vaucouleurs by Renaud, and they determine to insult Aymonet and Yon, in order to raise a quarrel.  One day Charlemagne presents Yon with a valuable knife; after receiving this gift Yon chances to push Constant with his elbow as he passes him; and Constant, seizing this opportunity to quarrel, calls him the son of a traitor, and challenges him to fight.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS34">This incident is differently related in the chanson.  Charlemagne calls Aymonet and Yon to bring him wine; during the meal Constant and Rohart throw down Yon and break the Emperor's cup; in the uproar the sons of Foulques challenge the sons of Renaud.</NOTE1> The Emperor endeavours to prevent the combat, and orders Constant to ask pardon of Yon; but the sons of Renaud both implore him to grant them the satisfaction of a duel.  Charlemagne consents, and orders the fight to take place on the Isle of our Lady, within Paris. He also sends word to Renaud to appear at Court, in order to witness the battle between his sons and the sons of Foulques. Renaud arrives at Paris on the appointed day with his three brothers and a large company of knights.  Griffon of Auteville lies in ambush near the battle-field ready to help the sons of Foulques in case of their discomfiture.  This plot is revealed to Renaud, who commands Richard to take his men to the Isle to protect his sons in case of treachery on the part of Griffon.</P><P>The Emperor and his Peers witness the battle, which lasts until all the four champions are grievously wounded; Aymonet finally<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000026" N="xxix"/> compels Constant to yield himself prisoner, and presents him to the Emperor.  Yon slays Rohart, and his brother Constant is hung by command of the Emperor.</P><P>After Aymonet and Yon are healed of their wounds, they take leave of Charlemagne, and return with their father to Montauban. Renaud divides his possessions between his two children, and clothed as a pilgrim departs from Montauban never to return again.  After wandering in the woods for many days he arrives at Cologne, where the Church of St. Peter is being built.  He works there as a labourer, and through his wonderful strength gains the approbation of the chief mason.  The other labourers are so jealous of him that they vow to kill him, and one day as Renaud is asleep under an archway they slay him and throw his body into the river Rhine in a sack, and answer the questions of the master mason as to Renaud's disappearance with jests.  A wonderful miracle is then manifested: the fish of the river support the body of Renaud upon the surface of the water, torches appear round the body, and angels are heard singing in the night.  The Archbishop with his clergy come to take the body out of the water, and on opening the sack they discover the corpse of the lost workman of St. Peter's Church.  The labourers then confess their crime and pray for mercy: the Archbishop contents himself with dismissing them from his service unpunished.</P><P>The corpse is laid in a coffin to be buried, but it rises slowly and is borne by invisible hands out of the church into a cart, which passes out of Cologne and carries the body to a little town called Croine,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS35">Tremogne in the chanson.</NOTE1> followed by the Archbishop and his clergy.  There it is laid in a small chapel, and the Archbishop uncovers the face of Renaud, in order that he may be recognised by the people collected there.</P><P>A pilgrim appears before the brothers of Renaud, and tells them of the miracles at Cologne.  They set forth for that city, and then go to Croine, where they discover the corpse of their brother; they reveal themselves to the Archbishop, who has the body of Renaud richly entombed at Cologne, where, as we are told, it rests unto this day—the memory of Renaud the Martyr being yearly commemorated by a service held in his honour.</P></DIV1><DIV1 NODE="AHA2639:3" TYPE="text"><EPB/><PB SEQ="00000027" N="3"/><HEAD>[Beginning of the four sones of Aymon, taken from Copland's edition (C. 12, i. 7), British Museum, London, 1554.</HEAD><DIV2 NODE="AHA2639:3.1" TYPE="prologue"><HEAD>The Prologue.</HEAD><P>As the philosopher, in the fyrst booke of hys metaphysyque, sayth, that every man / naturally desireth to know / and to con newe thynges: And therfore have the Clerkes / &amp; people / of great vnderstandynge desyred and concite to lerned sciences, and to know vertues of thinges.

'In good fayth,' sayde the kyng, 'ye counseylle me ryght well and wiselye.' Than thoughte Charlemagne what message he myght sende to him.

'Fayre sonne,' sayd Charlemagne, 'I recommend thee vnto god, that on ye crosse suffred death and passion, and hym I beseche to kepe and waraunt thee / &amp; all thy felawshyp from evyl / and from any combraunce.' Than departed Lohier and his company; wherof after warde / the kynge made great lamentacyon for his sonne Lohier, and not wyth out a cause; for he shal never see him quicke agayne, as ye shal vnderstand, yf ye wyll herken it.

Muche longe they spake of this mater; and the messangers of the kyng Charlemagne duryng the same / have riden so muche that they ben come to Aygremount. And the castell was set vpon a rocke ryght hye, and well envyroned with stronge walles / thycke, highe, and wel garnyshed with great towres, so that for the strength and sytuacyon of the castell, it was imprenable, but only by famyshynge.

'Freende,' answered Lohier / 'open to vs this gate presently, for we wyll speake to the Duke Benes of Aigremount from the kinge Charlemayn.' 'Now abyde you a lytle, and hast you not,' sayd the porter, 'and I wyl goe speake redely to my lorde the Duke.' So went the sayde porter into the halle / where he sawe the Duke his lorde. He kneeled incontynent afore him, &amp; tolde him howe downe at the gate was a right great company of men of armes; and that they were well an hondred men or more, ryght well horsed, &amp; well armed. 'And with them is the eldest sonne of king charlemagne, that strongly threteneth you / and also your folke. My lorde,' sayde the porter, 'shall I open the gates vnto them?' 'Yea,' sayd ye duke, 'for I doubt them nothynge, and we ben ynough for them; and many worthy knyghtes and esquyers / ben no where able for to defende vs all, were Charlemagne himself with them with his puissaunce.'  So ran incontinent the porter downe agayne / for to open vnto them the gate. Lohier &amp; his felowes entred within, and mounted vp  vnto the dongeon of the castell, where the duke was, that sayd to hys barons: 'Lordes, heere cometh the eldest sonne of the kyng Charlemagne / for to tell me his message; but (bi that god that suffred death and passyon) yf he speake wysely to vs, he shal do as sage; and yf he sayth anything that shall dysplease vs, we shall soone / &amp; without delaye, take vengeaunce therof.'
