{"englishTitle": "THE ENGLISH CHARLEMAGNE ROMANCES.: PARTS X, XI.: The Right Plesaunt and Goodly Historie of the Foure Sonnes of Aymon.: ENGLISHT FROM THE FRENCH BYWILLIAM CAXTON, AND PRINTED BY HIM ABOUT 1489.:  PARTS I-II ", "text": {"0": "INTRODUCTION. CAXTON'S \"right pleasant and goodly historie of the Four Sons|of Aymon\" is englisht from the French prose romance \"Les Quatre|Filz Aymon,\" which is a rendering more or less free of an ancient|chanson de geste bearing the same name, though more often entitled|\"Renaud de Montauban.\"  The earliest extant text of the chanson|is a remaniment of the end of the 12th century. For the history of the chanson de geste see Histoire Litteraire de la|France, vol. xxii. pp. 667-700; Renaud de Montauban, edited by H. V.|Michelant Stuttgard, 1843; and M. Longnon's paper in Romania, for 1878.|The general introduction to this series might also be examined together with|M. Gaston Paris' Histoire Po\u00e9tique de Charlemagne, pp. 19, 139, 298. The conversion of the poem into prose was not accomplished|before the close of the 14th century.  None of the prose manuscripts|are earlier than the 15th century.  Of them the British Museum|has three MSS., all in writing of the 15th century.  In one, Cat. of Romances, Brit. Museum, J. H. Ward, pp. 619-622. a|large vellum folio, about 1445 A.D., the story is illustrated by nine|miniatures; in the borders of the first appear the arms of John|Talbot, first Earl of Shrewsbury, and those of Henry VI. and his|Queen Margaret of Anjou empaled.  It is similar to the usual|printed edition, from the third chapter of that edition to the end.|Another manuscript, a vellum folio of the 15th century, is also a|prose version, to which is prefixed a fragment of a metrical version|of the story, the text of which closely resembles that published by|Bekker in his Introduction to \"Fierbras\"; another metrical fragment|is added at the conclusion of the prose tale, which contains the|adventures of Maugis, how he became Pope under the name of|Innocent, hears Charlemagne's confession, and is stifled by the|Emperor in a cave near Naples. The third manuscript at the British Museum contains a much|briefer text than that of the printed editions, and is imperfect at|the end. The French prose rendering of this romance is much inferior to|the poem in every sense, and cannot properly be deemed a direct|reproduction of it, although it follows the thread of the narrative|throughout, sometimes closely enough, at others wandering to a considerable|distance; but even while following, it robs the original of|half its beauties through its prosaic rendering.  The valuable historical|allusions are for the most part cast to the winds, the names|abstracted, the circumstances altered, the speeches shortened or|omitted, the sequence of the story being frequently unsettled. The palm for superior dramatic treatment must also be given to|the chanson's version of the chess-murder, on which the mincing of|the prose version has a damaging effect.  The toning down of the|ferocity of the chanson destroys the prose relation completely as a|picture of old time.  The story also can ill afford the omission made|in the prose of the curse with which Foulques of Morillon is first|introduced\u2014 \"En Fran\u00e7e ot i linage cui Dame Dex mal dont; Ce fu Grif d'Autefueille et son fil Guenelon, B\u00e9ranger et Hardr\u00e9 et Hervi de Lion, Antiaumes li felon, Fouques de Morillon.\" Renaus de Montauban, p. 39, ed. Michelant. The curse has an important bearing on the events which follow, and|gives, in fact, a key to the venom with which Foulques is pursued|throughout the story. The prose loses much by its rejection of the first embassage of|Charlemagne to Beuves d'Aigremont.  The murder of Enguerran,|which precedes that of the second ambassador, Lohier, the king's|son, lays a far broader basis for the Emperor's revenge, on which the|story is built, than the single murder of Lohier in the prose version. In connection with this, it may be well to notice the omission of|another striking passage from the prose, in which Charlemagne|swears vengeance on the murderers of his son and nephew\u2014 \"Il jure Dame Deu qui tot a \u00e0 jugier, Qu'il ne s'en tornera por Mars ne por Fevrier, Tant Kara pris Renaut qu'il ne puet avoir irer; As forches iert pendus, nus nel puet respitier. Richars sera detrais \u00e0 keue de somier, Ki ocist Loois \u00e0 l'esp\u00e9e d'acier Et Renaus, Bertelai au pesant eschekier,\" p. 57. The circumstance, which we know from history, of Charlemagne|having had a son who died young, gives an interest to this passage,|which should have pleaded for its preservation, and for that of|several others which allude to the same murder.  The exclusion of|many such passages of historical interest is a matter of regret.  One|passage may be instanced in which mention is made of the monastic|foundations of Gerard de Roussillon, to which pious works the name|of Doon de Nanteuil is joined with that of his brother.  Of them|it says\u2014 \"Il des confirent Karle lui et ses compaignons; J'en estora saint Pere de Cluigni le baron Et puis la charit\u00e9 et vezelai selone, Saint Beneoit sor Loire, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 si moine sont,\" p. 156. Of the early printed editions of the French prose romance, which|are numerous, the British Museum possesses four, two of Paris and|two of Lyons.  One alone of these editions is dated, that of Lyons,|1539.  The general catalogue of the Museum gives as probable dates|to the others, 1480, 1520, 1525 respectively.  The edition said to|be of Lyons, with the supposed date of 1480 attached to it, is a folio|volume whose typography is singularly beautiful.  The letters all|stand out distinctly, the type is large, and the words are amply|spaced.  Ornamental capitals head the paragraphs throughout.  Caxton's|translation of Les Quatre Fils Aymon, which he undertook \"at|the desire of John Erle of Oxenforde,\" seems to have been undoubtedly|made from this edition, as in portions of the story where these|various editions differ from each other, that of the 1480 edition is|invariably adopted by Caxton.  In his translation of this work,|Caxton shows himself piously literal.  Words and phrases, both|foreign and unusual, he transferred bodily to his text; nothing ever|deterred him, simply because it was French; he wandered along|every winding of the sentences he was rendering, and brought\n |them over with all their sinuosities into the English.  In consequence,|his translation is perhaps one of the most literal that has|ever been produced in the English language, and though to some|extent stilted and even awkward, yet it is impossible not to admire|his faithfulness to his original; and the very quaintness of those|peculiarities of language sometimes adds a charm to his composition. The few instances where Caxton has differed from the French|will be seen by the collations which have occasionally been marked|in foot-notes on the pages of this work. As a picture of the language of the time, his \"Four Sons of|Aymon\" is highly curious and interesting.  He continues the use|of double negatives\u2014so common in Chaucer and other Early-English|writers.  That this was not merely an imitation from the French, is|shown by Caxton making use of two where his original gives him|warrant only for one.  On p. 65, l. 24, \"Charlemagne made Aymon|to swere that he should never gyue no help to his children\"; p. 18,|l. 10, \"for doubte of death shall not leue nothynge unsayd of hys|message to the duke benes.\"  On p. 255, l. 27, \"All my lymmes|shaken for angre, nor I can not stande upon my feet.\"  In the|French there is but one negative.  Ed. 1480.  Caxton frequently|omits the pronominal subject of a verb in the clauses of a sentence,|which succeed the leading one, so that often the drift of the narrative|alone leaves the reader to decide the subject of the verb thus omitted.|This practice with him is generally an imitation of his original.  On|p. 238, l. 24, \"The frenshemen had wounded hym wyth two speres|well depe in to the flesshe and was taken for prysoner.\"  The|French is (Ed. 1480) \"et lavoient naure de deux espees bien parfond|en la cher et fut prins pour prisonnier.\" Caxton uses many words in the plural which are now allowed|only in the singular, this also is usually in obedience to his original.|On p. 262, l. 29, \"armed with his own armures\"; on p. 235, l. 32,|\"But their corages were never the lesse therfore.\"  Occasionally a|word occurs in the singular where a plural is now used: on p. 182,|l. 31, the troops are ordered to come, \"well garnysshed of vytaylle|for the space of vii. yeres.\"  The Midland plural in en occurs|frequently: on p. 3, l. 16, \"virtues which ben digne\"; p. 5, l. 2,\n |\"chapytres whiche speaken of many faire matters\"; p. 13, l. 27,|\"Bayard is yit a lyve in the forest of Ardeyne as men sayen.\"|The Southern plural in eth also occurs: on p. 70, l. 26, \"thise ben|the folke of themperour Charlemayn that goeth to Ardeyn.\"  Sometimes|the plural form now used is found in the singular: on p. 75,|l. 32, \"Themperour Charlemayn of fraunce lete you wyte by us that|ye sende to hym Guycharde.\" The possessive case of nouns in Caxton is made, as usual, by the|addition of s or es: thus on p. 77, l. 19, \"Charlemayn's folke\";|p. 13, l. 17, \"for goddes sake\"; though it is sometimes made in is,|p. 25, l. 8, \"Bayardis back.\"  On p. 283, l. 1, there is a singular|example, \"his face towarde the horse taylle.\" Caxton almost invariably uses ye for the nominative and you for|the objective case of the pronoun.  There is an exception on p. 172,|l. 31, due possibly to the compositor setting the MS. 'yu' = thou,|as 'you':\u2014\"I wote not what you sayste thou arte more like a foole|than a bysshop.\"  Also on p. 142, l. 7, \"I praye the for the love|that you haste to thy god, that thou gyve me trewes.\" Which is constantly used for persons, and so used is generally|preceded by the definite article.  That and that that are frequently|used instead of what, whose occurrence is rare in comparison with|these substitutes: on p. 70, l. 32, \"I conne you nother thank nor|grace of that that ye saye.\"  This (= pl. thise) is frequently used|for these: on p. 184, l. 20, \"I will departe the londe of Gascoyn to|this yonge knyghtes for theyr herytage.\"  Other is invariably used|for others, and self for selves: on p. 98, l. 28, \"Reynawde mounted|upon Bayarde and the other also lighted upon theyr horses.\"  A|very common use in Caxton\u2014as in many other writers\u2014is that of|the past participle losing its final n, and assuming an infinitive form|after an auxiliary verb.  On p. 3, l. 12, \"the clerkes haue had|great knowledge by innumerable volumes of bookes which haue be|made\"; p. 14, l. 3, \"Iherusalem was take agayne of the Christen.\"|A great many old or peculiar forms of the past tenses and participles|occur: on p. 137, l. 20, \"he hewe\"; p. 79, l. 11, \"flancardes all tobrosten\";|p. 176, l. 22, \"Euery man putted hymself for to renne.\"|The word conne, to be able, is constantly used; and a similar use is\n |made of may, on p. 227, l. 16, \"For wyte that yf I telled you not,|ye sholde not maye knowe it.\"  The form mowe of this verb sometimes|occurs: on p. 167, l. 25, \"ye shall mowe know the beste horse|of your royame.\"  Giving a future auxiliary to the verb will is|curious.  On p. 64, l. 21, \"il vous rendra au roy\" is translated, \"he|shall wyll yelde you to the kynge.\"  A striking feature of Caxton's|English is the number of reflective verbs with which it abounds.|On p. 4, l. 11, \"Whyche booke I haue endevorde me to accomplyshe.\"|P. 236, l. 18, \"Yet shall I selle me full dere or I deye.\"|An example may be given of verbs completed by prepositions:|p. 6, l. 30, \"and gaue them of havoyre so much, that they myghte|well make war with agenst the king.\"  Caxton has many substitutes|for present participles, which reduces their use considerably, as on|p. 70, l. 27, \"These ben the folke of themperour that goeth to|Ardeyn\"; p. 74, l. 32, \"sende a messager to Reynawde for to tell|hym that he yelde you Guycharde.\" He makes use also of a great many particles needless in modern|English, by the omission of many others in places where they are|now deemed indispensable.  A few characteristic sentences will|illustrate his practice in this respect.  On p. 154, l. 30, \"ioye began|to be grete in the castell as god had descended there\"; p. 87, l. 10,|\"So he swere god\"; p. 109, l. 3, \"he was so wery he myghte no|more.\" The adverb very had hardly come into use: it has many forerunners,|such as full, sore, right, etc. Nother is constantly used for neither; sith and syn for the later|since.  Ne is sometimes used for nor, in second alternatives, as on|p. 317, l. 31, \"I saw neuer nether crysten man, nother sarrasyn, soo|goodly a prynce, ne soo curteys as ye be one.\" An-angered is an intensitive by which Caxton translates the|French 'enrag\u00e9.'  But yf is another old expression continued by|him for unless: on p. 101, l. 9, \"it sholde hurte hym sore but yf he|myghte take theym.\" The use of doo with the infinitive\u2014'doo make' = cannot be|made,\u2014is another continuation by Caxton of an older usage, and is a|great contrast to modern English: on p. 18, l. 28, \"I shall doo\n |hange\"; p. 7, l. 21, \"And dyd doo make the castell of Montawban.\"|Sometimes the verb make is substituted for do, in its sense|of 'perform,' as on p. 84, l. 4, \"the grete fayttes of armes that he|made there.\" Caxton makes use largely of articles where they are now omitted,|and omits them frequently in places where they are always used, as|on p. 6, l. 5, \"it bare a great dommage to the realme\"; p. 8, l. 32,|\"Mawgys broughte suche a succourses.\" The order of words in sentences is frequently changed in Caxton's|text, as in earlier English: on p. 87, l. 18, Reynawde \"wente to|chasse in woodes & in ryvers as often as hym playsed\" = it pleased|him; on p. 117, l. 23, \"euerybody had of it pyte.\" The original edition of Caxton's \"Four Sons of Aymon\" has|neither title-page, printer's name, place, nor date.  It is a folio|volume, and the fortunate possessor of the only copy known is Earl|Spencer.  The celebrated founder of the Althorp Library, Earl|George, acquired it by purchase in the year 1822.  Of its previous|history we can discover nothing.  The date assigned to it by Blades,|in his life of Caxton, is 1489, and has been adopted from the|circumstance, that the works issued from Caxton's fount No. 6|range from 1489 to 1493.  Although Earl Spencer's copy is unique,|it is not perfect.  It lacks Caxton's prologue and colophon.  To|its owner I return the warm thanks of the Society and myself for|generously sending his treasure to the British Museum for so many|months for our use.  The General Catalogue of the British Museum|mistakingly represents that institution as the possessor of two leaves|of another copy of Caxton's \"Four Sons of Aymon.\"  Unfortunately,|however, there is really only one leaf, for the second is apparently an|extract from some work of devotion or popular theology, and though|resembling in both type and style the leaf to which it is attached|by the compiler of the Catalogue, has no connection with it.  The|genuine leaf is the beginning of chapter xxv, and is similar to the|corresponding leaf in Copland's edition.  Even the vignette which|heads the leaf is the same, and is a repetition from the block used|for chapter ix.  Four leaves of the same edition were discovered by|Mr. Blades to be in the possession of Mr. Green of Bishops Stortford\n |in 1882.  They are portions of signature E, and do not therefore|supply the defects of the Althorp copy. A second edition, as we learn from the colophon of the third|edition, was \"Imprinted at London by Wynken de Worde, the viii.|daye of Maye, and the yere of our lorde. M.cccc.iiii.\"  One leaf only|of this edition is known to be extant.  It was discovered in 1882|in a volume of early-printed fragments by Mr. Henry Bradshaw,|and is now in the Cambridge University Library. Copland's third edition was issued on 6th May 1554; the colophon|describes it as printed for Thomas Petit, not for Robert Toye, as|asserted by the Catalogue of the Harleian Library.  It was no doubt|printed for both these and other booksellers, as the 'trade' editions|of Chaucer were.  The prologue to this edition is undoubtedly a|literal reprint of Caxton's original preface, and it thus supplies one|of the chief defects of the Althorpe copy. For the bibliography of the romance, see two letters by Mr. W. Blades,|and one by Mr. S. L. Lee, Athen\u00e6um, Aug. 19, 26, and Sept. 9, 1882. Although no edition later|than Copland's is now known, entries in the Stationers' Registers|point to the conclusion that the romance was twice reprinted before|the close of the century.  Licences to reissue it were granted in|March 1582 (Arber's Transcript, ii. 408), and in February 1598-9|(ibid. iii. 137).  On 22nd Feb. 1598-9 a printer was licensed to|print \"the last part of the ffowre sons of Aymon\" (ibid. iii. 139). In Arber's Transcript, iv. 459, is an assignment of 'The four sonns of|Aymon' by Wm. Stansby, and his widow Elizabeth after his death, to Master|Bishop, on 4 March, 1639. The success of the story of the Sons of Aymon gave birth to|many and various editions.  The name and adventures of Renaud|were a passport to success of which poets availed themselves, and on|all sides there are testimonies to the universal fame of Bayard.  His|namesake, \"sans peur et sans reproche,\" is said when besieged in|Mezi\u00e8res, recalling the feats of the noble steed through the identity|of their names, to have answered the summons to surrender, sent|him by Prince Henry of Nassau, with the proud reply, \"A Bayard|of France will never yield to a cart-stallion of Germany.\"  The|noble Bayard carried the Sons of Aymon everywhere, and all lands|were eager to possess them and offer them a home.  Horse and|riders were depicted upon the walls of castles and convents.  \"On\n |the walls,\" says Roquefort, \"of the nunnery of St. Reynold in|Cologne, is a painting of four Paladins, mounted upon Bayard,|and Reynold is distinguished among them by an aureole, the sign of|saintship.\" Po\u00e9sie Fran\u00e7oise dans les xij.th et xiiith Si\u00e8cles, p. 141. Roquefort. It is well known that the medi\u00e6val romance of France became|the property of cultivated Europe.  From its source was supplied|the fuel of the worldly imagination, and Renaud taking a prominent|part was translated universally, and imitated in all fashions.  In the|13th century Maerland could speak of having read the history of|the Four Sons of Aymon in his native Flemish, \"Hiemskindre,|dat ic las.\" Reiffenberg, Philippe Mouskes, vol. ii. ccxiv. This translation is said to be due to Nicholas Vesboschten,|and it became the source of a German translation of the|13th century. Hist. poet. de Charl., G. Paris, p. 139. Through what channel the story of the Sons of Aymon found|passage to Iceland is uncertain.  It is still a question whether the|Icelandic versions originated from French manuscripts brought into|Norway, which were read by the Scandinavian reciters, or whether|they were learnt in France and brought over orally.  The numerous|manuscript copies testify to its popularity, the oldest of which may|be referred to the middle of the 13th century.  Here the story has|acquired a new name.  The Saga of Earl Magus adopts altogether a|strange character, it knows nothing at all of the sojourn of the Sons|of Aymon in Mountauban, mingles the story with that of Gerard,|in whom some recognize the hero of Vienne, brings Charlemagne|to live at Worms, and makes the chateau of Aymon Buslaraborg|in Germany, giving that of Strasburg to Magus.  The Saga was|published for popular reading at Reikavick in 1858. In Italy Renaud shone as the hero of every style of poetry,|whether chivalrous, amorous, or comic.  The \"Quatre Fils d'Aymon\"|formed one of the volumes of the 13th century \"Reali di Francia.\"|Renaud is one of Pulci's heroes; in Boiardo the Emperor Gradasse is|obliged to raise 150,000 men to conquer Bayard; and Renaud,|side by side with Roland, divides the honours of the famous\n |\"Orlando Innamorata\" of Ariosto.  Tasso's \"Rinaldo\" is based|immediately on the French romance of the Four Sons. Outside the world of letters altogether, the story has left its trace|in the popular traditions of certain portions of France, Belgium, and|Germany, chiefly in the neighbourhood of the Ardennes.  The name|of the Four Sons of Aymon still clings tenaciously to the ruins of|the rock-built Chateau of Ambleve, as does that of Bayard to a|chateau at Dhuy.  The whole North of France is associated with|the story, and the neighing of Bayard is still believed to be distinctly|heard through the valleys of the Ardennes.  In the beginning|of the 18th century the presses of Troyes found full employment|in its reproduction.  To this day Chateau-Renaud, surrounded by|the waters of the Meuse, is still believed to be the neighbourhood|of the retreat of Maugis and Bayard, and the Castle of Renout's|Steen, in the Province of Liege, is freely abandoned to them in the|surrounding universe of popular tradition.  In Brittany, a rude|dramatization of the original Epic witnesses to the popularity of|the story at the present day.  During the celebration of the Kermesse,|a Belgium popular feast, which is said to date back to the year 891,|an enormous horse bearing four knights, and decorated with their|escutcheons, paraded the streets of Louvain in 1490, behind the|corps of the University.  \"As late as the year 1825,\" says Reiffenberg,|\"Bayard repaired to Mechlin, to crown a feast framed on the|oldest models which was held there; and at Dortmund, in Westphalia,|Renaud is still held in heroic and saintly esteem.\"  M. L\u00e9on|Gautier also calls our attention to the pictures decorating the|chimneys of the peasant in France, where, by the side of rude|representations of the battle of Austerlitz and the Wandering Jew,|is seen that of the Four Sons of Aymon. Proofs of the popularity of the English translation of the|romance are not far to seek.  We know not only (as we have shown)|that reprints of it were numerous, but that the reprints were widely|read and appreciated during the later years of the 16th century.|The book is one of those which Cox, the Quixotic old captain of|Coventry, who took prominent part in the Kenilworth festivities|of 1575, had at his fingers' end.  Francis Meres, in the Palladis\n |Tamia, 1598 (p. 268b), mentions the work among others as \"no|lesse hurtfull to youth then the workes of Machiavell to age.\"|Wherever, in fact, in Elizabethan literature romances are under discussion,|the \"Four Sons of Aymon\" is brought into court, and|receives some sort of tribute to its popularity.  The least equivocal|of its commendations is the mention in \"Henslowe's Diary\" of the|fact that the story was dramatized, and arrangements made for its|production on the stage at the time that Shakespeare and his companions|were proving the potentialities of the English drama.  The|entries in the theatrical manager's diary runs as follows:\u2014 \"Layd owt for the componye, the 10 of desembr 1602|unto Robarte Shawe for a boocke of the 4 sonnes of|Amon the some of . . . . . xls.\" p. 230. \"Memorandum that I Robert Shaa have receaued of Mr. Phillip|Henshlowe the some of forty shellinges upon a booke called the fower|sonnes of Aymon, which booke, if it be not played by the Company|of the Fortune nor noe other company by my leaue, I doe then bynd|my selfe by theis presentes to repay the sayd some of forty shillinges|upon the delivery of my booke att Christmas next, which shall be in|the yeare of our Lord God 1603 and in the xlvjth yeare of the|Raigne of the Queene.  per me  ROBT. SHAA.\" p. 233. Proof is extant of the production of the play by a company of|English actors at Amsterdam, but nothing is known of Robert Shaw|or Shaa beyond the facts that he was an actor at Philip Henslowe's|theatre, received many small loans from his employer, and occasionally|assisted him in the management (Henslowe's Diary, pp. 96 et seq.).|It does not appear that the play was published. Thomas Heywood, in his Apology for Actors, 1612 (repr. in|Somers' Tracts (1810), iii. 574-600), the Third Booke, argues that,|among the benefits of plays, they \"haue beene the discouerers of|many notorious murders, long concealed from the eyes of the world\"|(sign. G, bk.; Somers, iii. 598).  And after citing an instance of|this 'at Lin in Norfolke,' and another of marauding Spaniards at|'a place called Perin [i. e. Penryn] in Cornwall,' being frightened|into flight by a battle on the stage, he goes on with the following\n |case of the play of the Four Sons of Aymon and Renaud's murder|(sign. G 2; Somers, iii. 599). \"Another of the like wonder happened at Amsterdam in Holland:|A company of our English Comedians (well knowne)|trauelling those Countreyes, as they were before the|Burghers, and other the chiefe inhabitants, acting the last part of the|4 sons of Aymon, towards the last act of the history, where penitent|Renaldo, like a common labourer, liued in disguise, vowing, as his|last pennance, to labour & carry burdens to the structure of a goodly|Church there to be erected, whose diligence the labourers enuying,|since, by reason of his stature and strength, hee did vsually perfect|more worke in a day, then a dozen of the best, (hee working for his|conscience, they for their lucres,) wherevpon, by reason his industry|had so much disparaged their liuing, conspired amongst themselues|to kill him, waiting some opportunity to finde him asleepe, which|they might easily doe, since the sorest labourers are the soundest|sleepers, and industry is the best preparatiue to rest.  Hauing spy'd|their opportunity, they droue a naile into his temples, of which wound|immediately he dyed. \"As the Actors handled this, the audience might on a sodaine|vnderstand an out-cry and loud shrike in a remote gallery; and|pressing about the place, they might perceiue a woman of great|grauity, strangely amazed, who, with a distracted & troubled braine,|oft sighed out these words: 'Oh, my husband, my husband!'  The|play without further interruption proceeded; the woman was to her|owne house conducted, without any apparent suspition, euery one|coniecturing as their fancies led them.  In this agony shee some few|daies languished; and on a time, as certaine of her well-disposed|neighbours came to comfort her, one amongst the rest being Churchwarden,|to him the Sexton posts, to tell him of a strange thing|happening him in the ripping vp of a graue: 'See here (quoth he)|what I haue found!' and shewes them a faire skull, with a great|nayle pierst quite through the braine-pan; 'but we cannot coniecture|to whom it should belong, nor how long it hath laine in the earth,|the graue being confused, and the flesh consumed.'  At the report of|this accident, the woman, out of the trouble of her afflicted conscience,|discouered a former murder.  For 12 years ago, by driuing|that nayle into that skull, being the head of her husband, she had|trecherously slaine him.  This being publickly confest, she was|arraigned, condemned, adiudged, and burned. \"But I draw my subiect to greater length then I purposed:|these, therefore, out of other infinites, I haue collected both for their|familiarnesse and latenesse of memory.\"", "1": "SKETCH OF THE STORY. THE story opens with an account of the Court of Charlemagne at|Paris, where nearly all the powerful Barons of the land are assembled,|and among them the Duke Aymon of Dordon, with his four sons,|Renaud, Alard, Guichard, and Richard.  Duke Beuves of Aigremont,|brother to Aymon, is absent from the court, and the Emperor is so|enraged by this insult, that he vows to besiege Aigremont, unless|Beuves promises to serve him next summer with a powerful army.|Duke Naymes advises Charlemagne to send a messenger to Aigremont,|and after some discussion, Lohier, the eldest son of the Emperor,|is sent there with a hundred knights. In the original chanson Enguerrand, the nephew of the Emperor, is first|sent to Aigremont, he is slain, and Lohier then undertakes the message and|shares the same fate.  A knight called Enquerrard of Peronne is killed at|Troyes by Beuves in this prose version. He delivers his message|insolently to Duke Beuves, who answers him with equal warmth, and|a fight ensues, in which Lohier is slain by Duke Beuves; his body|is conveyed to Charlemagne by the few survivors of his company|and buried at Saint-Germain.  The Emperor vows to revenge the|death of his son by besieging Aigremont. Meanwhile the Sons of Aymon have been created knights by|Charlemagne, and Renaud has been presented with the wonderful|horse Bayard. When Aymon hears of the death of Lohier, he departs with his|sons in haste to Dordon for fear of the Emperor's wrath. In the chanson Aymon is banished by Charlemagne before the death of|Lohier, and is received again into favour when the preparations for the attack|on Aigremont are being carried out; his sons are then created knights. Great|preparations are made at Paris for the campaign against Duke|Beuves; while the army are on their way to Aigremont, a messenger|informs them that Beuves is at Troyes, and is besieging that city|with the assistance of his brothers, Doon of Nantueil and Gerard of\n |Roussillon; This includes Aymon in the chanson, but no mention is made of his|being present at the siege of Troyes in the prose version; he is supposed to be|still at Dordon until after the death of Beuves. the inhabitants therefore implore the help of Charlemagne. The fact of Beuves having summoned his brother Gerard of|Roussillon to Aigremont, in order to march upon Troyes, has enlightened|us as to the situation of Aigremont.  M. Paris says: \"Le ch\u00e2teau Roussillon devait \u00eatre plus \u00e9loign\u00e9 de Troyes que|l'autre, puisque c'est le duc Girart qui va trouver son fr\u00e8re pour|marcher d'Aigremont sur Troyes.....  La situation d'un village|voisin de Chablis en Bourgoyne, encore aujourd'hui nomm\u00e9 Aigremont,|semble r\u00e9pondre aux indices que nous offre le texte des deux|(romances) de Girart et des quatre fils Aimon.\" The French army arrives at Troyes, where a battle takes place,|and lasts until sundown; the armies then cease fighting, neither side|having gained the victory.  Next day Beuves and his chief Barons|appear barefoot before the Emperor, and crave his pardon; which|having been granted to them, peace is proclaimed. Beuves promises to serve the Emperor at Paris on the feast of|St. John next summer.  On the way thither he is treacherously|slain by Earl Guenes, who has obtained Charlemagne's permission to|murder him. At the next assembly of the Barons at Paris, Aymon and his|four sons appear again. Renaud plays chess with Bertholais, the nephew of Charlemagne,|in the palace; they quarrel over the game, and Renaud, seizing the|chess-board, deals Bertholais a blow with it which causes his death. This incident is differently related in the chanson.  Renaud and Bertholais|quarrel during their game of chess, and Bertholais strikes Renaud,|who complains of this insult to the Emperor.  Charlemagne takes his nephew's|part, which causes Renaud to reply wrathfully to the Emperor, accusing him|of the murder of his uncle, Duke Beuves.  Charlemagne then deals Renaud a|blow; the latter retires, meets Bertholais, and slays him with the chess-board.  This scene seems to be an imitation of the death of Baldwin (a son of|Ogier), who is killed by Charlot (Charlemagne's son) with a chess-board, in|the chanson of \"Ogier le Danois.\" |A great tumult thereupon arises in the palace, and the sons escape|with much difficulty to Dordon, where they are received by their|mother.  They are soon obliged to quit Dordon for fear of the\n |Emperor's wrath and take refuge in the forest of Ardennes, where|they build a castle, called Mountaynford (Montessor), and conceal|themselves for several years.  M. Paris says: \"Il existe encore au-dessus de Sedan et de Mezi\u00e8res un village|nomm\u00e9 Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud situ\u00e9 sur le penchant d'une haute montagne|enferm\u00e9e par les eaux de la Meuse vers le midi l'est et l'ouest.  On|distingue aujourd'hui difficlement sur la roche quelques ruines d'une|forteresse, mais ces ruines avaient, il y a deux ans, plus de caract\u00e8re,|quand Malherbe notre grand po\u00ebte \u00e9crivait au savant antiquaire|Peiresc.  'La principaut\u00e9 de Madame la princesse de Conti s'appelle|Chasteau-Renaud, \u00e0 deux lieues de Sedan et autant ruin\u00e9, ou l'on|voit encore la tour de Maugis et l'estable de Bayard.'\" Charlemagne, as soon as he hears of the Sons' retreat, collects an|army and besieges the castle; No mention is made here of the Espans pass, supposed to be inhabited|by fairies.  In the chanson Charlemagne warns his men against the dangers|they may encounter in this ravine. the old Duke Aymon fights against|his children, as he has sworn to defend the Emperor's cause.  Terms|of peace are offered to Renaud if he will deliver up his brother|Guichard, which he indignantly refuses to accept.  The three gates|of the castle are then surrounded by the Frenchmen, but this does|not prevent the Sons from hunting daily in the forest.  After the|siege has lasted 14 months, Hernyer of Seveyne Hernyer of Lausanne; he is promised the town of Laon as well as the|castle.  The Espans pass is again alluded to when the Sons are chased from|Montfort in the chanson. promises to take|Renaud and his brother's prisoners, if Charlemage will give him the|castle as a reward.  He then approaches the castle and begs Renaud|to grant him shelter as an enemy of the Emperor's; Renaud believes|his story, and allows him to sleep in the castle; when all have retired|to rest, Hernyer lets down the drawbridge and signals to his men to|enter.  Fortunately for the Sons, Alard's horse wakes Renaud, who|rouses his brothers, and they fight their enemies valiantly; Charlemagne|sets a portion of the castle on fire; in the tumult Hernyer|and his followers are slain by Renaud, who afterwards escapes on|Bayard with his brothers into the Forest of Ardennes.  They are|pursued for some distance, but their enemies cannot overtake them.|Duke Naymes advises Charlemagne to give up the campaign and|disband his army.  This being done the Emperor returns to Paris. Aymon on his way to Dordon, meets his Sons encamping in the|Forest, when Renaud begs him to grant them peace, but Aymon|only reproaches him for his conduct; they fight, and lose heavily on|both sides, and the Sons with but 14 of their men are only saved|by crossing a small river. Aymon departs for Paris, taking with him the body of Esmenroi,|a favourite knight of Charlemagne's, who has been slain by Renaud.|He gives the Emperor a full account of the battle, but he is not|believed to have fought against his sons, and is received coldly by|Charlemagne; he therefore leaves Paris and arrives at Dordon, where|the Duchess blames him severely for his conduct towards his children. Renaud and his brothers wander in the forest until they are|nearly famished, and all their horses die, except Bayard, who thrives|on roots; at last they determine to go to Dordon and entreat their|mother to receive them.  They are not recognised in the streets of|the city as they pass through, and even their mother does not know|who they are at first; but she discovers Renaud by a scar on his|face, and welcomes them joyfully.  They sit down to supper, In the chanson the four brothers enter the palace and sit down to supper|before their mother recognises them. and|while they are relating their adventures, Aymon enters the castle.|He is furious with his Sons at first, but soon afterwards repents of|his conduct towards them, and allows the Duchess to give them food|and money; nevertheless, he will not break his promise to Charlemagne,|so he retires into the forest while his Sons inhabit the palace. Next day they depart from Dordon, and on their way meet|Maugis returning from the Court of Charlemagne, where he has|managed to steal a quantity of gold, which he divides with Renaud|and joins their company. They journey towards Bordeaux, and from the description of the|journey it is possible to determine the situation of Dordon, which is,|as M. Paris says: \"La ville actuelle de Dourdon effectivement situ\u00e9e dans cette|partie de la Brie Fran\u00e7aise nomm\u00e9e le Hurepois, et d'o\u00f9 l'on doit|passer dans le G\u00e2tinais puis dans l'Orl\u00e9anais, pour se rendre en|Aquitaine.\" On arriving at Bordeaux they offer their services to King John|of Gascony, who is at war with the Saracen King Bege (Borgons);|John willingly accepts their aid, and Renaud conducts the war so|successfully, that Bege is taken prisoner and peace proclaimed.|Renaud is then allowed to build the Castle of Montauban, and is|soon afterwards married to King John's sister Clare; the wedding|being solemnised with great ceremony at Montauban. The Emperor on his way to Gallicia passes Bordeaux, he looks|over the river Garonne, and marvels at the beauty and strength of|the castle newly built there.  On discovering that it belongs to|Renaud, he sends Ogier to demand the four sons from John; when|this request is refused, Charlemagne wishes to besiege the castle,|but his Barons demur, as they are tired of war.  At this juncture|Roland When Roland arrives at the Emperor's palace, he tells Charlemagne,|\"I am called Rowland of bretagne, and I am the sone of your suster and of the|duke Myllon.\"  These words accord with the history which makes Roland|governor \"des marches de Bretagne.\" arrives, and undertakes a campaign against the Saracens Saxons in the chanson. |on his uncle Charlemagne's behalf.  He besieges Cologne, takes the|Saracen chief prisoner, and returns to the Emperor. All Roland now requires is a good horse; for this reason Charlemagne|proclaims a horse-race at Paris, and the best steed is to be|bought for Roland.  Renaud determines to race Bayard, so he and|Maugis set out for their journey to Paris.  Maugis, in order that|they may not be recognised, changes Bayard from a black into a|white horse, and makes Renaud look like a boy of fifteen. Four miles outside Paris they meet Ogier and Naymes, whom|the Emperor has sent to guard the way; the Barons, however, do|not recognise them, and allow them to proceed. This incident is omitted in the chanson. They arrive at|Paris, and lodge in a shoemaker's house; but from some hints|dropped by Renaud, the man discovers their secret, and vows to|inform the Emperor, whereupon he is instantly slain by Renaud,|who escapes with Maugis from the house.  Bayard has his feet tied|by Maugis, in order that he may appear to be lame until after the|other horses have started, when he is unbound, and wins the race\n |easily.  Renaud seizes Charlemagne's crown, which is exhibited as a|prize, and telling the Emperor that he may look elsewhere for a|horse for Roland, rides hastily from the city, and swimming over|the river Seine, joins Maugis.  They arrive at Melun, where they|meet the other three Sons, and ride through Orleans to Montauban. In the chanson Renaud joins Maugis at Champeaux, they reach Monthery,|and then journey through Poitiers and Orleans to Montauban. The Emperor, determined to be revenged upon Renaud, It is on the Emperor's return from an expedition against the Saxons,|where he has killed the chief Guitechim, that he collects an army to besiege|Montauban in the chanson.  This incident is omitted in the prose version. assembles|a mighty army at Paris, during Eastertide, and marches towards the|Castle of Montauban, In the chanson Charlemagne marches first to Montbendel, which he|surrounds with his immense army: he admires the strength of the castle,|which, he says, is finer than Roche Guyon, Paris, or Orleans; \"that is|nothing,\" says Ogier, \"Montauban is a hundred times stronger.\"  Charlemagne|subdues the Castle of Montbendel, he hopes to conquer all Gascony in|the same manner without bloodshed.  The siege is then directed towards|Montauban. where they encamp.  Roland and Oliver pitch|their tent at Balencon, near the river, and go hawking one day,|thinking they may leave the camp in safety, but Renaud discovers|their absence, goes forth against Charlemagne's army, which he|surprises, and finally, having captured the golden dragon from|Roland's tent, returns to his castle with much plunder. This incident is not mentioned in the chanson. The Emperor, in despair of ever taking the castle, despatches a|messenger The name of Girard the Spaniard, who advises Charlemagne to demand|the surrender of the Sons, and of Gainemark, who undertakes the message, are|mentioned in the chanson.  When the messenger arrives, King John attempts|to strike him, threatening to have him hung; his barons interfere.  John|then consents to consider Charlemagne's proposals, and keeps the messenger|three days for his answer.  This incident is very differently related in the prose|version, where John receives the herald courteously, and tells him, \"ye must|tari here a seven night\" for his answer. to ask King John to deliver up to him the four Sons;|after a long discussion with his Barons Among the Barons who argue with John for the deliverance of the Sons|to Charlemagne is the Lord of Montbendel, who in speech mentions the surrender|of his castle, referring to that portion of the siege by Charlemagne|which is omitted in the prose version. John consents to betray|them, which he does by sending them unarmed to the plain of|Vaucouleurs, where the Barons of Charlemagne await to take them|prisoners.  The Sons discover the treachery of King John when they\n |arrive at Vaucouleurs, but they nevertheless fight bravely against an|enormous host of adversaries, and finally gain a respite through the|kindness of Ogier.  Meanwhile Maugis, who is at Montauban, hears|from King John's secretary of the plot against his cousins, and sets|off for Vaucouleurs, where he arrives in time to rescue them.  King|John on receiving the news of their rescue, flies to an abbey in the|wood of the Serpent, where he seeks refuge for a time, but is discovered|by Roland, who takes him prisoner.  John, in terror of his|life, contrives to send a messenger to Renaud, who is now at Montauban,|beseeching him to come to his assistance.  Renaud and his|brothers ride forth to meet Roland, and a battle ensues, in which|Renaud is victorious, and rescues King John, but Richard remains a|prisoner in the hands of Roland.  Maugis, in order to save Richard|from the cruelty of Charlemagne, departs for the Emperor's tent disguised|as a poor pilgrim, and arrives before Roland has returned with|Richard.  Maugis completely deceives the Emperor, who orders food|to be given to him as a holy man. When Maugis appears before the Emperor, and craves for food, he asks|Charlemagne to put it in his mouth, as a dream has led him to believe that|thereby he will be saved from all his sufferings.  Charlemagne consents to this;|no mention is made of the palmer's staff in the chanson. Roland then enters the tent, and|presents Richard to Charlemagne, who declares that he shall be hung|without delay.  Richard recognises Maugis, and is therefore certain of|escape from the hands of the Emperor.  Maugis then leaves the tent,|and retires hastily to Montauban; he orders Renaud and his two|brothers to arm themselves and with an army to proceed to the tent|of Charlemagne. Renaud willingly consents, and proceeds to Monfaucon with his|folk, where they encamp in a wood near the gallows which are being|prepared for Richard, but unfortunately they fall asleep from extreme|weariness.  Meanwhile Charlemagne commands the execution of|Richard, and orders several of his Barons to perform the deed, but|they all refuse on various pretexts, until Ripus of Riplemond undertakes|the duty.  Richard is led before the gallows, and believing|that there is no chance of escape for him, begs for time in which|to pray, and confesses to a priest.  Just as he has finished his confession,|and is prepared for death, his brothers (who have been\n |awakened by the sagacious Bayard) appear, and a fight ensues, in|which Ripus is killed by Renaud, who gives his armour to Richard;|the latter, with four hundred men, presents himself before Ogier,|who is rejoiced over the victory of the Sons.  Richard afterwards|meets Charlemagne, they fight, Renaud and his men join in the|battle, and after a prolonged skirmish, the Sons enter the Emperor's|pavilion with three thousand men, and bear away the golden eagle,|which Renaud conveys to Montauban.  Maugis is left alone with|the Emperor's army, and fights bravely for his liberty, but is over-powered|by Oliver, who presents him to Charlemagne, just as the|latter is complaining of his subjects' infidelity to him in allowing|the Sons of Aymon to escape.  The Emperor vows to slay Maugis|without delay.  The Sons meanwhile have returned to Montauban,|where they discover the absence of their cousin.  Renaud, in great|anxiety for his fate, mounts Bayard, and goes to the river Balencon;|he meets there two pages from the Emperor's camp, who tell him|that Maugis is in Charlemagne's hands.  Renaud vows to rescue him|next day. The Emperor commands his Barons to prepare a gallows on|which to hang Maugis; but Naymes begs him to delay the execution|until the following day, and Charlemagne consents to this, on condition|that Maugis will promise not to escape.  The twelve peers|give their pledges for his safety, and prepare to watch over him all|night; but Maugis, who has been put in irons, nevertheless contrives|to charm all his guardians to sleep, and then departs, taking with|him the Emperor's sword, and those of Roland and Oliver, with|much treasure to Montauban.  On the way thither he meets Renaud|at the river-side of Balencon, and the cousins journey together to the|castle, where much feasting and rejoicing takes place.  Richard shows|Maugis the golden eagle which they have captured, and it is set up|on the high tower of the castle.  Naymes and Ogier are sent to|Montauban by Charlemagne to demand the surrender of his sword,|in return for which a truce shall be granted them for two years.|Renaud consents to these conditions, and, moreover, goes back with|the Barons to the Emperor's camp.  He is conducted before Charlemagne,|who vows he shall be slain, but a compromise is effected, in\n |which Renaud and Roland are doomed to fight a duel on the morrow.|At Monfaucon the battle begins, but the final contest between the|heroes is prevented by the appearance of a miraculous cloud, and|Roland goes with Renaud to Montauban as his prisoner. Charlemagne besieges the castle, but in the night Maugis, through|the medium of a charm, carries the Emperor asleep to Montauban;|he then leaves the castle, and goes over the river Dordogne into a|hermitage, where he lives poorly, doing penance for his sins.  The|Sons discover the presence of the Emperor in Montauban still asleep,|they search for Maugis, but are bitterly afflicted when they hear he|has left them.  Charlemagne will not consent to peace unless Maugis|is given up to him, but Renaud allows him to return to his tent|unharmed with the Barons.  Charlemagne, vowing he will starve the|Sons into submission, has the castle surrounded by his men, and|although Renaud several times repulses the enemy, he can gain no|advantage over them.  Great famine prevails in Montauban, and all|the horses, except Bayard, are slain for food.  Renaud, as a last|resource, goes to the tent of Duke Aymon and implores him to give|his starving children food.  Aymon finally consents, and sends provisions|into the castle by means of the engines used in the assaults|on Montauban, which he fills with food instead of stones.  The|Emperor discovers that Aymon has been befriending his children,|and dismisses him from his army for this offence. The Sons are again reduced to starvation, but are finally saved|by an old man in the castle, who shows Renaud a secret passage from|Montauban into the wood of the Serpent.  All the people abandon|the castle and go to the monastery, where Renaud's friend Bernard|dwells; and after obtaining food and wine from him they depart for|Arden (or Dordon, in the French prose version), where they are|joyfully received by the people of the town. In the chanson the Sons are said to go to Tremogne, not Arden or|Dordon.  This Tremogne is the ancient name for Dortmund in Westphalia,|which position would account for the fact that Charlemagne passes Liege to|go to Paris; from Dordon this would be impossible. Charlemagne quickly discovers the flight of the Sons from Montauban|and the secret passage; he immediately orders his army to|besiege Arden (Dordon).  As they hasten towards the castle, Renaud\n |perceives their approach, and at once orders a number of his knights|to arm and accompany him in his attack upon the Emperor.  Renaud|and his army are obliged, however, to retreat after a fierce skirmish|with the enemy; and having captured Duke Richard of Normandy,|they take him prisoner into the castle.  The Peers all implore|Charlemagne to make peace with the Sons for fear they should slay|Duke Richard; but the Emperor is still persistent in his refusal.|King John at this time dies in the castle.  Maugis within his|hermitage has a dream of the distress of his kinsmen, and he sets|forth towards Arden.  On the way he encounters two merchants,|who have been robbed by thieves in the wood; Maugis slays the|robbers and gives back the plunder to the merchants, and he hears|from them of the condition of the Sons, and hastens towards their|castle, which he enters in the guise of a pilgrim, and is served with|food as a stranger.  Renaud towards night recognises him, and great|joy is made over his arrival.  Next day he departs for the Holy|Land.  R naud causes a gallows to be erected on the walls of his|castle, in order to hang Duke Richard; seeing this Charlemagne is|persuaded by his Barons to send Duke Naymes to the castle with|terms of peace; the conditions being that Renaud should give up|Bayard to the Emperor and depart to the Holy Land in poor array,|begging his bread as a pilgrim, while his brothers keep all his lands|during his absence.  Renaud accepts these conditions, and after|clothing himself poorly and commending his wife and children to|the protection of Duke Richard, departs from his castle.  Charlemagne|takes possession of Bayard, and on his way to Paris stays at|Liege, where he orders the horse to be thrown into the river Meuse,|with a millstone round his neck.  This command is carried out, but|Bayard contrives to break the stone, and swimming to land, gallops|away unharmed into the forest of Ardennes. Renaud arrives at Constantinople and lodges with a holy woman,|who tells him there is another pilgrim in the house lying sick;|Renaud goes to see the pilgrim, and finds his cousin Maugis.  They|meet joyfully, and after feasting together set forth for Jerusalem.|They find a largo army surrounding the Holy City; on inquiring the|cause of this, they are told that the Admiral of Persia has taken the\n |city by treason, and it is being besieged by the Christians.  Renaud|and Maugis pass through the Christian encampment, and set up a|small tent for themselves.  Next morning the enemy advances|towards their tent, which in the confusion of battle is overthrown.|Renaud In the chanson Renaud mounts a mule and pnrsues the enemy, while|Maugis showers stones upon the Saracens. mounts a wall near by, and with a large fork or tent pole|defends the way, and assisted by Maugis, slays numbers of the enemy.|Earl Rames Geffroi, orig. approaches the two pilgrims, and on learning their|history welcomes them with delight; he provides them with rich|clothing and armour, giving the command of his army to Renaud.|King Thomas, No mention is made of King Thomas in the chanson; Geffroi of|Nazareth is in command of the Christian army, and is subsequently made|King of Jerusalem at the conclusion of the war.  When Renaud enters Jerusalem|he goes straight to the Holy Sepulchre, where he and Maugis offer their|devotions. who is a prisoner within Jerusalem, wonders why so|much feasting and rejoicing is taking place amidst his army.  Next|day the Admiral renews his attack on the Christians, the Saracen|King Margary is slain by Renaud, and after a fierce battle the|Saracens are discomfited, and fly towards the city pursued by Earl|Rames.  Renaud contrives by placing a large beam under the portcullis|to keep open the gate into Jerusalem, and the Christian army|enters and takes possession of the city.  The Admiral vows to slay|King Thomas unless Renaud will grant him terms of peace, and|allow of his safe conduct back to Persia; to these conditions|Renaud consents, and peace is concluded amidst general rejoicings.|King Thomas prepares a ship, which he fits out for Renaud and|Maugis, in order that they may return to France.  After eight|months at sea they arrive at Palermo. In the chanson this incident of Renaud's encounter with the Persian|Admiral is entirely omitted.  They take ship at Acre and go straight to|Brindisi, whence Renaud journeys to France, and arrives at Tremogne|(Dortmund) in Westphalia.  Maugis retires to his hermitage. King Simon of that town|receives them gladly, and tells them how his lands are daily wasted|by the Persian Admiral.  Renaud and Maugis vow to assist him|against his enemy.  They encounter the Admiral and rout his forces,|compelling him to retire utterly discomfited.  Soon after this Renaud|and Maugis take leave of King Simon and journey by sea to Rome,\n |where they confess to the Pope, and having received his benediction|depart for France.  They are joyfully received at Arden by the|three brothers, and from them Renaud hears of the death of his wife|Clarisse.  He takes his two children and Maugis to Montalban,|where the people of that town welcome them gladly.  Maugis then|takes leave of Renaud and departs for his hermitage, where thirteen|years afterwards he dies.  Renaud prepares his two sons for their|journey to Paris to be presented to Charlemagne, and sends them to|the Court with an escort of five hundred knights. In the chanson Renaud accompanies his sons to Paris. They arrive there,|and are graciously received by Charlemagne, who confers on them|the honour of knighthood, and raises them to the post of carvers at|his table.  This rouses the jealousy of Constant and Rohart, the two|sons of Foulques, whose father was slain at Vaucouleurs by Renaud,|and they determine to insult Aymonet and Yon, in order to raise a|quarrel.  One day Charlemagne presents Yon with a valuable knife;|after receiving this gift Yon chances to push Constant with his|elbow as he passes him; and Constant, seizing this opportunity to|quarrel, calls him the son of a traitor, and challenges him to fight. This incident is differently related in the chanson.  Charlemagne calls|Aymonet and Yon to bring him wine; during the meal Constant and Rohart|throw down Yon and break the Emperor's cup; in the uproar the sons of|Foulques challenge the sons of Renaud. |The Emperor endeavours to prevent the combat, and orders Constant|to ask pardon of Yon; but the sons of Renaud both implore him to|grant them the satisfaction of a duel.  Charlemagne consents, and|orders the fight to take place on the Isle of our Lady, within Paris.|He also sends word to Renaud to appear at Court, in order to|witness the battle between his sons and the sons of Foulques.|Renaud arrives at Paris on the appointed day with his three brothers|and a large company of knights.  Griffon of Auteville lies in ambush|near the battle-field ready to help the sons of Foulques in case of|their discomfiture.  This plot is revealed to Renaud, who commands|Richard to take his men to the Isle to protect his sons in case of|treachery on the part of Griffon. The Emperor and his Peers witness the battle, which lasts until|all the four champions are grievously wounded; Aymonet finally\n |compels Constant to yield himself prisoner, and presents him to the|Emperor.  Yon slays Rohart, and his brother Constant is hung by|command of the Emperor. After Aymonet and Yon are healed of their wounds, they take|leave of Charlemagne, and return with their father to Montauban.|Renaud divides his possessions between his two children, and clothed|as a pilgrim departs from Montauban never to return again.  After|wandering in the woods for many days he arrives at Cologne, where|the Church of St. Peter is being built.  He works there as a labourer,|and through his wonderful strength gains the approbation of the|chief mason.  The other labourers are so jealous of him that they|vow to kill him, and one day as Renaud is asleep under an archway|they slay him and throw his body into the river Rhine in a sack,|and answer the questions of the master mason as to Renaud's disappearance|with jests.  A wonderful miracle is then manifested: the|fish of the river support the body of Renaud upon the surface of the|water, torches appear round the body, and angels are heard singing|in the night.  The Archbishop with his clergy come to take the|body out of the water, and on opening the sack they discover the|corpse of the lost workman of St. Peter's Church.  The labourers|then confess their crime and pray for mercy: the Archbishop contents|himself with dismissing them from his service unpunished. The corpse is laid in a coffin to be buried, but it rises slowly and|is borne by invisible hands out of the church into a cart, which|passes out of Cologne and carries the body to a little town called|Croine, Tremogne in the chanson. followed by the Archbishop and his clergy.  There it is laid|in a small chapel, and the Archbishop uncovers the face of Renaud,|in order that he may be recognised by the people collected there. A pilgrim appears before the brothers of Renaud, and tells them|of the miracles at Cologne.  They set forth for that city, and then|go to Croine, where they discover the corpse of their brother; they|reveal themselves to the Archbishop, who has the body of Renaud|richly entombed at Cologne, where, as we are told, it rests unto this|day\u2014the memory of Renaud the Martyr being yearly commemorated|by a service held in his honour.", "2": {"0": {"0": "The Prologue.", "1": "As the philosopher, in the fyrst booke of hys|metaphysyque, sayth, that every man / naturally|desireth to know / and to con newe thynges: And therfore|have the Clerkes / & people / of great vnderstandynge|desyred and concite to lerned sciences, and to|know vertues of thinges.
