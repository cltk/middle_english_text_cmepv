The kinge hym kissyd and knight & swayne; To a chamber the kynge hym lad; feyre in Armys they gon hym fold, And sette hym on A Riche bedde That sprad was with a clothe of gold; To serve hym was there no man sad Ne dight hym as hym-self wold To make hym bothe blithe and glad; And sithe Auntres he them told. Thre dayes in courte he dwellid there That he ne spake not with the quene: So myche prees was Ay hym nere; The kyng hym lad and courte by-dene.

By hym \u00feat bought me with his blode, Off these tydandes know I none; But by these wordis thynkith me A-way ye wold \u00feat I ware; Now haue good day, my lady fre, For sothe thou seest me nevir mare.\" Oute of the chambyr \u00fean wendis he; Now whethir his hert was full of Care! The lady swownyd Sithes thre Almost she slew hyr-self[e] thare. launcelot to his chambyr yede, There his owne atyre in lay, Armyd hym in a noble wede, Thoughe in his hert were litell play; Forthe he spronge as sparke of glede, Withe sory chere, for sothe to say; Vp he worthis vppon his stede And to a foreste he wendis a-way. Tithyngis come in-to the halle That launcelot was vppon his stede; Oute than Ranne the knightis alle, Off there witte as they wold wede; Boerte de Gawnes and lyonelle And Ector that doughty was of dede Folowyn hym on horsys snelle, Fulle lowde gonne they blowe and grede. There might no man hym ovir-take, he Rode in-to a forest grene; Moche mone gonne they make The knightis that were bold and kene. \"Allas!\" they sayd, \"launcelot du lake, That euyr shuldistow se the quene!\" And hyr they cursyd for his sake That euyr loue was them by-twene. They ne wiste nevir where to fare Ne to what land \u00feat he wold; Ageyne they went with sighyng sare, The knightis \u00feat were kene & bold; The quene they found in swownyng thare, hyr comely tresses all vnfold; They were so full of sorowe & Care There was none hyr comfort wold. The kynge than hastis hym for his sake And home \u00fean come that ylke day, And asked after launcelot du lake, And they sayd: \"he is gone away.\" The quene was in hyr bed all nakyd, And sore seke in hyr chambyr lay, So moche mone the kynge gon make, There was no knight \u00feat lust to playe. The kinge klepis Gawayne \u00feat day And alle his sorow told hym tylle: \"Now ys launcelot gone A-way And come, I wote, he nevir wille.\" he sayd \"allas and wellaway!\" Sighed sore and gaff hym ylle: \"The lord that we have lovid all-way, In courte why nylle he nevir dwelle!\" Gawayn spekis in that tyde And to the kynge sayd he there: \"Sir, in this castelle shall ye byde, Comforte you and make good chere, And we shall bothe go and Ride In all landis ferre and nere; So preuely he shall hym not hyde Throughe happe that we ne shall of hym here.\" [K]nyghtis than sought hym wide, Off launcelot myght they not here, Tylle it felle vppon a tyde, quene Genure, bright as blossom on brere, To mete is sette that ylke tyde, And syr Gawayne satte hyr nere, And vppon that other syde A scottysshe knight \u00feat was hyr dere. A squyer in the courte hath thought, That ylke day, yif that he myght, With a poyson \u00feat he hath wrought To slae Gawayne, yif that he mighte; In frute he hath it forthe brought And sette by-fore the quene bright; An Appille ouereste lay on lofte, There the poyson was in dighte, For he thoughte the lady bright Wold the beste to Gawayne bede, But she it yaff to the scottisshe knight, For he was of an vnkouth stede. There-of he ete a lytell wight, Off tresoun toke there no man hede; There he loste both mayne and might And died sone, as I you Rede. They nyste what it myght by-mene, But vp hym sterte syr Gawayne, And sithen all the courte by-dene, And ouyr the bord they haue hym drayne. \"Wellaway!\" than sayd the quene, \"Ihesu Criste! what may I sayne! Certis, now will all men wene My-self that I the knight haue slayne.\" Triacle there was anone forth brought, The quene wende to save his lyff, But all that myght helpe hym noght, For there the knight is dede as swithe; So grete sorow the quene than wrought, Grete doele it was to se and lythe; \"lord, suche syttes me haue sought! Why ne may I nevir be blithe!\" Knyghtis done none other myght, Bot beryed hym with doele I-noughe, At a chapell with Riche lyghte, In a foreste by a cloughe; MS. swoughe. I have adopted here Seyferth's ( p. 78) conjecture. Cp. l. 893. A Riche toumbe they dyd by dight, A Crafty clerke the lettres droughe, how there lay the shottysshe knyght That quene Genure with poyson slough. Aftyr thys a tyme by-felle, To the courte ther come a knyght, his brodyr he was, as I you telle, And syr mador for sothe he highte; he was an hardy man and snelle, In turnamente and eke in fight, And mykell louyd in Courte to duelle, For he was man of myche myght. Than it felle vppon a day, Sir mador wente with mekill pride In-to the foreste, hym for to play, That floured was and braunchid wyde; he found a chapell in his way, As he cam by a cloughis syde, There his owne brodyr lay, And there at masse he thought to abyde. A Riche toumbe he found there dight With lettres that were fayre I-noughe; A while he stode and Redde it Right, Grete sorow than to his herte droughe, he found the name of the scottysshe knight That quene Genure with poysoun sloughe; There he loste bothe mayne and myght And ouyr the toumbe he felle in swoughe. Off swownynge whan he myght awake, his herte was heuy as Any lede; he sighed for his brothers sake, he ne wiste what was beste Rede; The way to courte gan he take, Off no-thinge ne stode he drede; A lovde Crye on the quene gonne make In chalengynge of his brothers dede. The kynge fulle sore than gan hym drede, For he myght not be ageyne the Right; The quene of witte wold nyghe wede; thoughe In the MS . That is written at the beginning of this line\u2014by mistake . \u00feat she agilte had no wight, She moste there by-know the dede, Or fynde a man for hyr to fight; For welle she wiste to deth she yede yif she were on a queste of knightis. Thoughe Arthur were kynge \u00fee land to weld, he myght not be agayne the Righte; A day he toke with spere and sheld To fynd a man for hyr to fight, That she shalle eyther to deth hyr yeld Or putte hyr on a queste of knightis; There-to bothe there handis vp-held And trewly there trouthis plighte. Whan they in Certeyne had sette a day And that quarelle vndir-take, The word sprange sone throw eche contrey What sorow that quene genure ganne make; So at the laste, shortely to say, Word come to launcelot du lake, There as he seke I-woundyd lay; Men told hym holly all the wrake, how that quene Genure the bright had slayne with grete treasoun A swithe noble scottishe knight At the mete with stronge poysoun; There-for a day was taken Right That she should fynd a knight full bowne For hyr sake for to fighte Or ellis be brente with-oute Raunsowne. Whan \u00feat launcelot du lake had herd holly all this fare, Grete sorow gon he to hym take, For the quene was in suche care, And swore to venge hyr of that wrake That day yif \u00feat he lyvand ware; Than payned he hym his sorows to slake And wexe as breme as Any bare. [N]ow leve we launcelot there he was, withe the ermyte in the forest grene, And telle we forthe of the case That touchith Arthur the kynge so kene. Sir Gawayne on the morne to conselle he tase And mornyd sore for the quene; In-to a toure than he hym has And ordeyned the beste there them by-twene; And as they in there talkynge stode, To ordeyne how it beste myght be, A feyre Ryuer vndyr the toure yode, And sone there-in gonne they see A lytelle bote of shappe full good To theyme-ward with the streme gon te; There myght none feyrer sayle on flode Ne better forgid as of tree. Whan kynge Arthur saw \u00feat sighte, he wondrid of the Riche apparrayle That was aboute the bote I-dighte, So Richely was it coueryd sanzfayle, In maner of a voute with clothis I-dighte, Alle shynand as gold as yt ganne sayle. Than sayd Sir Gawayne the good knight: \"This bote is of A ryche entayle.\" \"For sothe, sir,\" sayd the kynge tho, \"Suche one sawgh I neuyr Are; Thedir I Rede now \u00feat we go; Som aventures shalle we se thare; And yif it be with-in dight so As with-oute or gayer mare, I darre sauely say therto, By-gynne wille auntres or ought yare.\" Oute of the toure adowne they wente, The kynge arthur & sir Gawayne; To the bote they yede with-oute stynte, They two allone, for sothe to sayne; And whan they come there as it lente, They by-held it faste, is not to layne; A clothe that ouer the bote was bente Sir Gawayne lyfte vp, and went in bayne. Whan they were in, with-outen lese, Full Richely aRayed they it found, And in the myddis a feyre bedde was For Any kynge of Cristene lond. Than as swithe, or they wold sese, The koverlet lyfte they vp with hand; A dede woman they sighe ther was, The fayrest mayde \u00feat myght be found. To Sir Gawayne than sayd the kinge: \"For sothe dethe was to vn-hende, Whan he wold thus fayre a thinge Thus yonge oute of the world do wend; For hyr biaute with-oute lesynge I wold fayne wete of hyr kynd, What she was, this swete derelynge, And in hyr lyff where she gonne lend.\" Sir Gawayne his eyen than on hyr caste And by-held hyr fast with herte fre So that he knew welle at the laste, That the mayde of Ascalote was she, Whiche he som tyme had wowyd faste his owne leman for to be, But she aunsweryd hym Ay in haste, \"To none bot launcelot wold she te.\" To the kinge \u00fean sayd sir Gawayne tho: \"Thinke ye not on this endris day, Whan my lady the quene & we two stode to-gedir in youre play, Off a mayde I told you tho That launcelot louyd paramoure Ay?\" \"Gawayne, for sothe,\" the kynge sayd tho, \"Whan thou it saydiste wele thinke I may.\" \"For sothe, syr,\" \u00fean sayd sir Gawayne, \"This is the mayd that I of spake; most in this world, is not to layne, She lovid launcelot du lake.\" \"For sothe,\" the kynge \u00fean gon to sayne, \"me Rewith the deth of hyr for his sake; The inchesoun wold I wete full fayne; For sorow I trow deth gon hyr take.\" Than sir Gawayne, the good knight, Sought aboute hyr with-oute stynte, And found a purs fulle Riche a-Righte, With gold and perlis \u00feat was I-bente; All empty semyd it noght to sight. That purs full sone in hond he hente, A letter there-of than oute he twight: Than wete they wold fayne what it mente; What there was wreten wete they wold; And sir Gawayn it toke the kynge And bad hym open yt MS. openyd. that he shold; So dyd he sone with-oute lesynge; Than found he whan it was vn-fold, Bothe the ende and the by-gynnynge, Thus was it wreten, as men me told, Off that fayre maydens deynge: \"To kyng arthur and all his knightis That longe to the Round table, That corteyse bene and most of myghtis, Doughty and noble, trew and stable, And most worshipfull in all fyghtis, To the nedefull helpinge & profitable, The mayde of Ascalot to Rightis Sendith gretinge, with-outen fable: To you all my playnte I make Off the wronge that me is wroghte, But noght in maner to vndir-take That Any of you shold mend it ought; Bot onely I say for this sake, That, thoughe this world were throw sought, Men shold nowhere fynd your make, All noblisse to fynde that myght be sought; There-fore to you to vndirstand That, for I trewly many a day haue lovid lelyest in lond, Dethe hathe me fette of this world away; To wete for whome yif ye will found, That I so longe for in langoure lay, To say the sothe will I noght wound, For gaynes it not for to say nay; To say you the sothe tale, For whome I haue suffred this woo, I say deth hathe me take with bale For the noblest knight \u00feat may go; Is none so doughty dyntis to dale, So Ryalle ne so fayre ther-to; But so churlysshe of maners in feld ne hale Ne know I none of frende ne fo; Off foo ne frend, the sothe to say, So vn-hend of thewis is ther none; his gentillnesse was all a-way, All churlysshe maners he had in wone; For for no thinge \u00feat I coude pray, Knelynge ne wepinge with Rewfull mone, To be my leman he sayd euyr nay And sayd shortely he wold haue none.

Saugh nevir no man A stronger fyght; Vn-horsid were bothe knyghtis kene, They metten with so myche mayne, And sythe thay faught with swerdys kene, Bothe on fote, for sothe to sayne; In Alle the batailles that launcelot had bene, With hard acountres hym A-gayne, In poynte had he nevir bene So nyghe hande for to haue be slayne. There was so wondyr stronge A fyghte, O fote nolde nouther fle ne founde frome loughe none tylle late nyght, Bot gyffen many a wofull wounde. launcelot than gaffe A dynte with myght, Syr mador fallys at laste to grounde; \"Mercy,\" cryes that noble knyght, Fore he was seke and sore vnsound.

Kynge Arthur than loude spake A-monge hys knyghtis to the quene: \"&YOGH;a, yonder is launcelot du lake, Yiff I hym euyr with syght haue sene.\" Thay Ryden and ronne than for hys sake, The kynge and Alle hys knyghtis kene; In hys armys he gon hym take, The kynge hym kyste and courte by-dene.

Whan syr mador herde All the Ryght, That no gylte hadde the lady shene, For sorowe he loste mayne and myghte And on knees felle be-fore the quene; launcelot then hym helde vppe Ryghte For loue that was them be-twene; Hym kyste bothe kynge and knyght And sythen All the curte by-dene. The squyer than was done to shende, As it was bothe lawe and Ryght, Drawen and hongyd and for-brende Be-fore syr mador, the noble knyghte.

An Armyd knyght be-fore in wente, And wende launcelot wele to sloo, Bot launcelot gaffe hym soche A dynte That to the grounde gonne he go; The other All agayne than stente; Aftyr hym dorste folowe no moo; To the chambyr dore he sprente And claspid it with barres twoo.

Launcelot than smote with herte goode, Wete ye welle, with-outen lese; Syr Agrawayne to dethe yode, And sythen All the other presse; Was non so stronge that hym with-stode Be he had made A lytelle Rese; Bot mordreit fled as he were wode, To saue hys lyff full fayne he was. Launcelot to hys chambre yode, to bors and to hys other knyghtis; Bors Armyd be-fore hym stode, To bedde yit was he no&yogh;t dight; The knyghtis for fere was nye wode, So were they drechyd all that nyght, Bot blythe wexid they in her mode Whan they her mastyr sawghe with syght. \"Syr,\" sayd bors, the hardy knyght, \"Aftyr you haue we thoght full longe, To bedde durste I ne no&yogh;t dight, For drede ye hade som Aunter stronge; Owre knyghtis haue be drechyd to-nyght, That som nakyd oute of bed spronge, For-thy we were full sore a-fryght Leste som treson were vs Amonge.\" \"Ya, bors, drede the no wight, Bot bethe of herte good And bolde, And swythe A-waken vp All my knyghtis And loke whiche wille with vs holde; Loke they be Armyd and redy dight, For it is sothe that thou me tolde, We haue be-gonne thys ilke nyght That shall brynge many A man full colde.\" Bors than spake with drery mode: \"Syr,\" he sayd, \"sithe it is so, We shalle be of hertis good Aftyr the wele to take the wo.\" The knyghtis sprent as they were wode And to there harneise gon the go; At the morow Armyd be-fore hym stode An hundrethe knyghtis and squyers mo. Whan they were armyd and redy dight, A softe pas forth gonne they Ride, As men that were of mykelle myght, To A forest there be-syde; Launcelot Arrayes All hys knyghtis And there they loggen hem to byde Tylle they herd of the lady bryght, What Auntere of hyr shulde be-tyde. Mordreit than toke A way full gayne, And to the forest wente he Right, Hys Auntures tolde, for sothe to sayne, That were by-fallyn that ylke nyght. \"Mordreit, haue ye that treitour slayne, Or how haue ye with hym dight?\" \"Nay, syr, bot dede is aggrawayne, And so Ar All oure other knyghtis.\" Whan it herde syr gawayne, That was so hardy knyght and bolde, \"Allas! is my brother slayne?\" Sore hys herte be-gan to colde; \"I warnyd wele syr Aggrawayne, Or euyr yit thys tale was tolde, Launcelot was so myche of mayne, A-yenste hym was stronge to holde.\" It was no lenger for to byde, Kynge And All hys knyghtis kene, Toke there counselle in that tyde, What was beste do with the quene. It was no lenger for to byde, That day fo[r]-brent shuld she bene. . . . . . . . . . . no gap in the MS. The fyre than made they in the felde, There-to they brought that lady fre, All that euyr myght wepene welde A-boute her Armyd for to bee. Gawayne, that stiffe was vndir shelde, Gaheryet ne gaheryes ne wold no&yogh;t see; In there chamber they hem helde Off hyr they had grete pyte. The kynge Arthure that ylke tyde Gawayne And gaherys for sent; here Answeres were no&yogh;t for to hyde, They ne wolde no&yogh;t be of hys assente; Gawayne wolde neuyr be nere by-syde There Any woman shuld be brente; Gaheriet And gaheries with lytelle pryde, All vn-Armyd thedyr they wente. A squeer gonne tho tythandes lythe, That launcelot to courte had sente; To the foreste he wente as swithe There launcelot and hys folke was lente, Bad hem come and haste blythe, The quene is ledde to be brente; And they to hors and Armes swythe And Iche one be-fore other sprente. The quene by the fyre stode And in hyr smoke All redy was; lordyngis was there many and good And grete power, with-outen lese. Launcelot sprente, as he were wode, Full sone partyd he the prees, Was none so styffe a-&yogh;eynste hym stode, Be he had made a lytelle Rese. There was no stele stode hem a&yogh;eyne; Though faught they but A lytelle stound, Lordyngys that were myche of mayne Many goode were brought to grounde; Gaheriet and gaheries bothe were slayne, Wythe many A doulfull dethes wounde; The quene thay toke with-oute layne, And to the foreste gonne they founde. The tythyngis is to the kynge brought, how launcelote has tane away the quene. \"Suche wo as there is wroughte! Slayne ar Alle oure knyghtis kene.\" Downe he felle and swounyd ofte, Grete duelle it was to here and sene; So nere hys herte the sorowe sought All-moste hys lyffe wolde no man wene; \"Ihesu cryste! what may I sayne? In erthe was neuyr man so wo; Suche knyghtys as there ar slayne In All thys worlde there is no mo. Lette no man telle Syr gawayne, Gaheriet hys brother is dede hym fro, But weilaway! the reufulle Rayne, That euyr launcelote was my fo!\" Gawayne gonne in hys chambyr hym holde, Off All the day he nolde not oute goo; A squyer than the tythandys tolde What wondyr theighe hys herte were wo! \"Allas!\" he sayde, \"my brother bolde, Where gahereit be dede me fro?\" So sore hys hert be-gan to colde All-moste he wolde hym-selff sloo. The squyer spake with drery mode, To re-comfort syr Gawayne: \"Gaheriet eyles noght bot goode; he wolle sone come A-gayne.\" Gawayne sprent as he were wode To the chambre there they lay slayne; The chambre flore Alle ranne on blode, And clothys of golde were ouer hem drayne. A clothe he heuys than vppon hyght; What wondyr thoughe hys hert were sore So dulfully to se them dight That ere so doughty knyghtis were! Whan he hys brother sawghe with syght, A word myght he speke no more; There he loste mayne and myght And ouyr hym felle in swounynge thore. Off swounynge whan he myght A-wake, The hardy knyght, syr gawayne, Be god he sware and loude spake, As man that myche was of mayne: \"Be-twixte me And launcelote du lake Nys man in erthe, for sothe to sayne, Shall trewes sette and pees make, Er outher of vs haue other slayne.\" A squyer that launcelot to court hadde sente Off the tythandys gonne he lythe; To the foreste is he wente And tolde launcelot Also swythe, how lordy[n]ges that were Riche of rente Fele goode had loste hyr lyffe, Gaheryet and gaheries sought here ende; Bot than was launcelot no-thynge blythe; \"Lord,\" he said, \"what may thys bene? Ihesu cryste! what may I sayne? The loue that hathe be-twexte vs bene, That euyr gaheryet me was A-gayne! Now I wote for All by-dene, A sorye man Is syr gawayne; A-cordement thar me nevyr wene, Tille eyther of vs haue other slayne.\" launcelot gonne with hysse folke forthe wende, With sory hert and drery mode; To quenys and countesses fele he sende And grete ladyes of gentill blode, That he had ofte here landis deffende And foughten whan hem nede by-stode. Ichone her power hym lende, And made hys party stiffe and goode; quenys and countesses that Ryche were Sende hym erlys with grete meyne; Other ladies that myght no more Sente hym barons or knyghtis free; So mykelle folke to hym gon fare, Hydous it was hys oste to see; To the Ioyus gard wente he thare And helde hym in that stronge Cyte. Launcelotis herte was full sore For the lady fayre and bryght; A damosselle he dyd be yare, In Ryche Apparayle was she dyght, Hastely in message for to fare To the kynge of mykelle myght, To prove it fals (what myght he mare?) Bot proferys hym there-fore to fyght. The mayden is Redy for to Ryde, In A full Ryche Aparaylmente, Off Samytte grene, with mykyll pryde, That wroght was in the oryente; A dwerffe shulde wende by hyr syde, Suche was launcelotis comaundement; So were the manerys in that tyde, Whan A mayde on message wente. To the castelle whan she come, In the paleise gonne she lyght; To the kynge hyr erande she sayd sone, By hym satte syr gawayne the knyght, Sayd that lyes were sayde hym vppon; Trewe they were by day and nyght; To proue it as a knyght shulde done Launcelot proferis hym to fyghte. The kynge Arthure spekys thore Wordys that were kene and thro: \"He ne myght proue it neuer more Bot of my men that he wold slo; Be Ihesu cryste,\" the kynge sware, And Syr gawayne than Also, \"his dedis shall be bought full sore, Bot yife no stele nyll in hym go.\" The mayden hathe hyr answere, To the Ioyus garde gonne she Ryde; Such as the kynges wordis were She told launcelot in that tyde; Launcelot Syghed wounder sore, Teres frome hys y&yogh;en ganne glyde; Bors de gawnes by gode than sware: \"In mydde the felde we shall hem byde.\" Arthure wolde no lenger a-byde Bot hastis hym with All hys myght; Messengeres dyd he go and Ryde, That thay ne shulde lette for day ne nyght, Thorow-oute yngland by Iche a syde To erle, baroun and to knyght, Bad hem come that ilke tyde Withe hors stronge And Armure bryght. Thoughe the knyght that were dede hem fro, There-of was All there mykelle kare, Thre hundrethe thay made mo, Oute of the castelle or they wold fare, Off ynglonde A[nd] yreland Also, Off walys and scottis that beste were, Launcelot And hys folkys to slo, With hertis breme as Any bore. Whan thys oste was All bowne, It was no lenger for to byde, Rayses spere and gounfanoune, As men that were of mykelle pryde; With helme and shelde and hauberke browne, Gawayne hym-selfe be-fore ganne Ryde To the Ioyus garde that Ryche towne, And sette A sege on Iche A syde. A-boute the Ioyus garde they laye Seuentene wokys And well mare, Tille it felle vppon A day launcelot home bad hem fare: \"Breke youre sege! wendys a-waye! You to slae grete pyte it ware.\" He sayd \"Allas and weilawaye! That euyr beganne this sorewe sare!\" Evir the kynge and Sir gawayne Calde hym fals Recreante knyght, And sayde he had hys bretherne slayne And treytour was by day and nyght, Bad hym come And proue hys mayne In the felde with hem to fyghte. Launcelot sighed, for sothe to sayne, Grete duelle it was to se with sight. So loude they launcelot gonne Ascrye With vois and hydous hornys bere, Bors de gawnes standis hym by And launcelot makys yuelle chere. \"Syr,\" he sayd, \"whare-fore and why Shulde we these proude wordys here? me thynke ye fare as cowardlye As we ne durste no man nyghe nere. Dight we vs in Ryche Araye, Bothe with spere And with shelde, As swithe as euyr that we maye, And Ryde we oute in-to the felde; Whyle my lyffe laste maye, Thys day I ne shall my wepen yelde; There-fore my lyffe I darre wele laye We two shall make hem All to helde.' \"Allas!\" quod launcelot, \"wo is me, That euyr shuld I se with syghte A-&yogh;eyne my lord for to be, The noble kynge that made me knyght! Syr gawayne, I be-Seche the, As thou arte man of myche myght, In the felde let not my lorde be Ne that thy-selfe with me not fyghte.\" It may no lenger for to byde But buskyd hem and made All bowne; Whan thay were Redy for to Ryde, They Reysed spere and gonfanoune; Whan these ostes gan samen glyde, Withe vois and hydous hornys sowne, Grete pyte was on eyther syde, So fele goode ther were layd downe. Syr lyonelle with myche mayne Withe A spere by-fore gan founde; Syr gawayne Rydys hym A-gayne, hors and man he bare to grounde, That All men wende he had ben slayne, Syr lyonelle hade suche A wounde; Oute of the felde was he drayne, For he was seke and sore vn-sounde. In All the felde that ilke tyde Myght no man stonde launcelot a-&yogh;eyne, And sythen as faste As he myght Ryde To saue that no man sholde be slayne. The kynge was euyr nere be-Syde And hewe on hym with All hys mayne, And he so corteise was that tyde O dynte that he nolde smyte a-gayne. Bors de gawnes saughe at laste And to the kynge than gan he Ryde, And on hys helme he hytte so faste That nere he loste All hys pryde; The stede Rigge vndyr hym braste That he to grounde felle that tyde, And sythen wordys loude he caste, Withe Syr launcelot to chyde: \"Syr, shalthou All day Suffer so That the kynge shall the assayle, And sethe hys herte is so thro Thy corteise may not A-vaile? Batailles shall there neuere be mo, And thou wilt do be my consalle; &YOGH;euyth vs leue them All to slo, For thou haste venquesshid thys bataille.\" \"Allas!\" quod launcelot, \"wo is me, That euyr shulde I se with syghte By-fore me hym vnhorsyd bee, The noble kynge that made me knyght!\" he was than so corteise and fre That downe of hys stede he lyghte; The kynge ther-on than horsys he And bade hym fle, yiffe that he myght. Whan the kynge was horsyd there, Launcelot lokys he vppon, How corteise was in hym more Then euyr was in Any man; He thought on thyngis that had bene ore, The teres from hys y&yogh;en Ranne; He Sayde \"Allas!\" with syghynge sore, \"That euyr yit thys werre be-gan!\" The parties arne with-drawen A-waye, Off knyghtis were they wexyn thynne; On morow on that other daye Scholde the bataille efte begynne; Thay dyght hem on A Ryche Araye And partyd ther ostes bothe in twynne; he that by-ganne thys wrechyd playe, What wondyr thoughe he had grete synne! Bors was breme as Any bore, And oute he rode to syr gawayne; For lyonelle was woundyd sore, Wenge hys brother he wolde full fayne; Syr gawayne gonne A-&yogh;eyne hym fare, As man that myche was of mayne; Eyther throughe other body bare, That welle nere were they bothe slayne; Bothe to grounde they Felle in fere, There-fore were fele folke full woo. The kynges party Redy were A-way to take hem bothe two; launcelot hym-selfe come nere, Bors rescous he them froo; Oute of the felde men hym bere, So were they woundyd bothe two. Off thys bataille were to telle, A man that it wele vndyrstode, How knyghtis vndyr sadels felle And sytten downe with sory mode; Stedys that were bolde and snelle A-monge hem waden in the blode, Bot by the tyme of euyn belle Launcelot party the better stode. Off thys batayle was no more, Bot thus depa[r]ten they that daye; Folke here Frendys home ledde and bare That slayne in the feldys laye. Launcelot gonne to hys castelle fare, The scribe by mistake began this leaf with the first seven lines of leaf 113, but afterwards struck them out. The bataille venquesshyd, for Sothe to saye; There was duell and wepynge sare, Amonge hem was no chyldys playe. [Into] all landys northe and southe Off thys werre the word spronge, And yit at Rome it was full couthe, In ynglande was suche sorowe stronge; There-of the pope had grete Routhe, A lettre he selid with hys hande; Bot they accorded welle in trowthe, Enterdite he wolde the lande. Then was A bischope at Rome, Off Rowchester, with-outen lese; Tylle ynglande he, the message, Come, To karllylle ther the kynge was; The popis lettre oute he nome In the paleis by-fore the desse, And bade them do the popis dome And holde yngland in Reste and pes.

Launcelot and the quene were cledde In Robes of A Riche wede, Off Samyte white, with syluer shredde, yuory sadyll and white stede, Saumbues of the same threde, That wroght was in the heythen thede; launcelot hyr brydelle ledde, In the Romans as we Rede; The other knyghtis euerychone In Samyte grene of heythen lande And in there kyrtelles Ryde Allone, And Iche knyght a grene garlande, Sadillis sette with Ryche stone, Ichone A braunche of olyffe in hande, All the felde A-boute hem schone; The knyghtis Rode full loude synghand.

To the Ioyus gard, the Ryche towne, Rode launcelot, the noble knyghte; Busked hem and made A bowne, As men that were of myche myght, Withe spere in hand and gonfanowne (lette they nouther day ne nyght) To An hauen hight kelyon; Ryche galleys there they fande dyght. Now ar thay shyppyd on the flode, launcelot And hys knyghtis hende; Wederes had they feyre and goode Wher hyr wille was for to wende, To An hauen there it stode As men were leueste for to lende; Off benwike blythe was hyr mode, Whan Ihesu cryst hem thedir sende. Now ar thay Aryued on the stronde, Off hem was fele folke full blythe; Grete lordis of the lande, A-&yogh;eyne hym they come as swythe, And fellyn hym to fote and hande; For her lord thay gonne hym kythe, At hys domys for to stande, And at hys lawes for to lythe. Bors made he kynge of gawnes, As it was bothe law and Ryght; lyonelle made kynge of fraunce, Be olde tyme gawle hyghte; All hys folke he ganne Auance And landys gaffe to Iche A knyghte, And storyd hys castellys for All chance, For mykyll he hopyd more to fyght. Estor he crownys with hys hande, So sayes the boke with-outen lese, made hym kynge of hys fadyr lande And prynce of All the Ryche prese; Bad no thynge hym shulde with-stande, Bot hald hym kynge as worthy was, For ther [no] more hym-self wold fande Tylle he wiste to leffe in pes. Arthure wolle he no lenger A-byde, nyght and day hys herte was sore; messengerys did he go And Ryde Throughe-oute yngland for to fare To erlys And barons on Iche A syde, Bad hem buske and make All &yogh;are, On launcelot landys for to Ryde, To brenne and sle and make All bare.

Was A boke by-fore hym brought; Syr mordreit they to steward chese; That many A bolde sythen A-bought. It was no lenger for to byde, But buskes hem And made All bowne; Whan they were Redy for to Ryde, They Reised spere and gonfanowne; Forthe they went with mykelle pryde Tylle An hauyne hyght kerlyonne, And graythes be the lande syde Galeis grete of fele fasowne. now are they shippid on the see And wendyn ouyr the water wyde; Off benwyke whan they myght se, Withe grete Route they gonne vp Ryde; with-stode hem neyther stone ne tre, Bot brente and slow on Iche A syde; launcelot is in hys beste Cyte, There he batelle wolle A-byde. launcelot clepis hys knyghtis kene, His erlys And hys barons bolde, Bad hem ordeyne hem by-twene, To wete her wylle, what they wolde, To Ryde A-&yogh;eyne hem All by dene Or ther worthe walles holde; For well they wiste, with-outen wene, For no fantyse Arthur nold folde. Bors de gawnes, the noble knyght, stornnely spekys in that stounde: \"Doughty men that ye be dyghte, Foundis your worship for to fownd, Withe spere and shelde and armes bryght A-&yogh;eyne your fo-men for to fownd; Kynge and duke, erle and knyght, We shall hem bete And brynge to grounde.\" Lyonelle spekys in that tyde, That was of warre wyse And bolde: \"Lordyngis, yet I rede we byde And oure worthy walles holde; Le[t] them pryke with All ther pryde Tylle they haue Caught bothe hungre and colde; Than shall we oute vppon them Ryde And shredde them downe as shepe in folde.\" Syr banndemagew, that bolde kynge, To launcelot spekys in that tyde: \"Syr, cortessye And your sufferynge Has wakend vs wo full wyde; Awise you welle vppon thys thynge: Yiff that they ouer oure landys Ryde, All to noght they myght vs brynge, Whyle we in holys here vs hyde.\" Galyhud, that Ay was goode, To launcelot he spekys thare: \"Syr, here ar knyghtis of kynges blode That longe wylle not droupe And dare; Gyffe me leue, for crosse on Rode Withe my men to them to fare; Thoughe they be wers than outlawes wode, I shall them sle and make full bare.\" Off northe gales were bretherne seuen, Ferly mekelle of strenghe and pryde; Not full fele that men coude neuyne Better dorste in bataile byde; All they sayd with one steuen: \"Lordyngis, how longe wolle ye chyde?

The mayde was full shene to shewe, Vppon her stede whan she was sette, Hyr paraylle All of one hewe, Off A grene weluette, In hyr hand A braunche newe, For-why that no man sholde her lette; Ther-by men messangerys knewe In ostes whan that men them mette. The kynge was lokyd in A felde By A ryuer brode And dreghe; A while she houyd And by-helde; Pavylons were pyghte on hyghe; She saughe there many comly telde Wythe pomelles bryghte as goldis beghe; On one hynge the kyngis shelde, That pauylon she drew hyr nyghe. The kynges baner oute was sette, That pauylon she drewe her nere; With A knyght full sone she mette, hyght Syr lucan de bottelere; She hailsed hym and he her grette, The mayde with full mylde chere; hyr erande was not for to lette, he wiste she was A messengere. Sir lucan downe gan hyr take And in hys Armes forthe gan lede; hendely to her he spake, As knyght that wise was vndyr wede: \"Thou comeste from launcelot de lake, The beste that euyr strode on stede; Ihesu, for hys modyris sake, Yiffe the grace wele to spede!\" Feyre was pight vppon a playne The paviloun in Ryche A-parayle; The kynge hym-selfe and syr gawayne Comely sytten in the halle; The mayde knelyd the kynge A-gayne, So lowe to grounde gan she falle; here lettres were not for to layne, They were I-rade A-monge hem All. hendly and feyre the mayden spake, Full fayne of speche she wold be sped: \"Syr, god yow saue from wo And wrake And All your knyghtis in Ryche wede; Yow gretis wele, syr launcelot du lake, That with yow hathe bene euyr at nede; A xii monthe trewse he wolde take To lyue vppon hys owne lede, And sythen, yiffe ye make an heste, he wille it holde with hys honde, By-twene you for to make pees Stabully euer for to stonde; He wolle Rape hym on A Resse Myldely to the holy londe, There to lyue, with-outen lese, Whyle he is man lyvande.\" The kynge than clepid hys counsayle, Hys dou&yogh;ty knyghtis All by-dene; Fyrste he sayde, with-outen fayle: \"me thynke it were beste to sene; he were A fole, with-outen fayle, So feyr forwardys for to fleme.\" The kynge the messyngere thus did assayle: \"It were pite to sette warre vs by-twene.\" \"Sertis, nay,\" sayd syr gawayne, \"he hathe wroght me wo I-noughe, So traytourly he hathe my bredren slayne, All for your loue, sir, that is treuthe, To yngland will I not torne A-gayne Tylle he be hangid on a boughe; Whyle me lastethe myght or mayne, There-to I shall fynd peple I-noghe.\" The kynge hym-self, with-owten lese, And Iche A lord, is nought to layne, All they spake to haue pese, But hym-self, syr gawayne, To batayle hathe he made hys hest Or ellys neuer to torne A-gayne. They made hem Redy to that Rese, There-fore was fele folke vnfayne. The kynge is comyn in-to the halle And in hys Royall see hym sette; He made A knyght the mayden calle, Syr lucane de botteler, with-outen lette: \"Say to launcelot and hys knyghtis All, suche an heste I haue hym hette, That we shall wend for no walle Tyll we with myghtis onys haue mette.\" The mayde had hyr Answere, Withe drery hert she gan hyr dyght; hyr feyr palfrey fande she yare, And Syr lucan ledde hyr thedyr Ryght; So throw A foreste gan she fare And hasted her with All hyr myght, There launcelot and hys knyghtis were, In benwyk the browgh with bemys bryght. Now is she went with-in the walle, The worthy damysselle fayre in wede; Hendely she Cam in-to that halle, A knyght hyr toke downe of hyre stede; A-monge the pryncis proude in palle She toke hyr lettres for to Rede; There was no counsayle for to calle, But Redely buskis them to that dede; As folkys that preste were to feight, Frome feld wold they neuyr fle; But by the morow that day was lyght A-boute by-segyd was All there Fee; ychone theym MS. theyne.

Erly as the day gan sprynge, The trompettis vppon the wallis went; There myght they se a wondyr thynge, Off teldys Riche and ma[n]y A tente. Syr arthur than, the comely kynge, with hys folkis ther was lente, To yeff Assaute, with-oute lesyng, with Alblasters and bowes bente. Launcelot All for-wondred was Off the folke by-fore the walle; But he had rather knowen that rease, Oute had ronne hys knyghtis All; he sayd: \"pryncis, bethe in pease, For folyse fele that myght by-falle; yiff thay will not ther sege sease, Full sore I hope for-thynke hem shall.\" Than gawayne, that was good at euery nede, Graythid hym in hys gode Armour, And styffly sterte vppon A stede That syker was in ylke A stoure; Forthe he sprange as sparke on glede, By-fore the yates a-gayne the toure; he bad A knyght come kythe mayne, A cours of werre for hys honoure. Bors de gawnes buskys hym bowne Vpon A stede that shuld hym bere, With helme, sheld, And hauberke browne, And in hys hand A Full good spere; Owte he Rode A grete Randowne; Gawayn kyd he covde of werre; hors and man bothe bare he downe, Suche A dynte he yaffe hym there. Syr lyonelle was All redy than And for hys broder was wonder woo; Redely with hys stede oute Ranne And wende gawayne for to sloo. Gawayn hym kepte as he wele can, As he that ay was kene and thro; Downe he bare bothe hors and man, And euery day som seruyd he soo. And so more than halfe a yere, As longe as they there layne, Euery day men myght se there Men woundyd and som slayne, But how that euer in world it were, Suche grace had sir gawayne, Euer he passyd hole and clere; There myght no man stand hym Agayne. Than it by-Felle vponn A tyde, Syr gawayne, that was hende and free, He made hym redy for to Ryde By-fore the gatis of the Cyte; Launcelot of treson he be-Cryed That he had slayne hys bretherne thre, That launcelot my&yogh;te no lenger A-byde, But he euer A cowarde scholde be. The lord that grete was of honoure, Hym-selffe, sir launcelot du lake, A-bove the gatis vppon the toure Comely to the kynge he spake: \"My lord, god saue youre honoure! Me ys wo now for yowre sake, A-gaynste thy kynne to stonde in stoure, But nedys I muste thys batayle take.\" Launcelot armyd hym full wele, For sothe had Full grete nede, Helme, hawberke and All of stele And stifely sterte vppon A stede; Hys harneyse lacked he neuer A dele, To were wantyd hym no wede, No wepyn with All to dele; for-the he sprange as sparke on glede. Than was it warnyd faste on hye How in world that it shu[l]d fare, That no man schold come hem nye Tylle the tone dede or yolden were. Folke with-drew them than bye, Vpon the feld was brode and bare; The knyghtis mette, As men it sye, how they sette there dyntis sare. Than had syr gawayne suche a grace, An holy man had boddyn that bone, Whan he were in Any place, There he shuld batayle done, Hys strength shulld wex in suche A space, From the vndyr-tyme tylle none, And launcelot for-bare ay for that case; A-gayne xx strokys he yaff not one: Launcelot saw ther was no socoure, nedysse muste he hys venture Abyde; many A dynt he gan wele in-dure Tylle it drew nere the noon tyde; Than he straught in that stoure And yaffe gawayne A wond wyde; The blode All coueryd hys coloure And he felle downe vpon hys syde. Throw the helme in-to the hede Was hardy gawayne woundyd so That vnneth was hym lyfe leuyd; On fote myght he no ferther goo; But wightly hys swerd A-bowte he wavyd, For euer he was bothe kene and thro. launcelot than hym lyAnd levyd; For All the world he nold hym slo. launcelot than hym drew on dryhe; hys swerd was in hys hand drawen; And syr gawayne cryed lowde on hye: \"Traytour And coward, come A-gayne, Whan I Am hole And goynge on hye; Than wylle I prove with myght and mayne, And yit A thow woldyst nyghe me nye, Thow shalt wele wete I am not slayn.\" \"Gawayne, while thow myghtis styfflye stonde, many A stroke to-day of the I stode, And I for-bare the in euery londe For love and for the kyngis blode; Whan thou arte hole in herte and hond, I rede the torne and chaunge thy mode; Whyle I am launcelot and man levande, Gode sheld me frome werkys wode! But have good day, my lord the kynge, And your doughty knyghtis Alle; Wendyth home A leue youre werryeng; ye wynne no worshyp at thys walle; And I wold my knyghtis oute brynge, I wote full sore rewe it ye shalle; My lord, there-fore, thynke on suche thynge, how fele folke there-fore myght falle.\" launcelot, that was moche of mayne Boldely to hys Cyte wente; Hys good kny&yogh;tis [there]-of were fayne And hendely hym in armys hente. The tother party tho toke syr gawayne, They wessche hys woundys in hys tente; Or euer he coueryd myght or mayne, vnnethe was hym the lyffe lente. A fortenyght, the sothe to saye, Full passynge seke and vn-sonde There syr Gawayne on lechynge laye, Or he were hole All of hys wounde. Than it by-felle vppon A day, he made hym Redy for to wound; By-fore the yat he toke the way And Askyd batayle in that stownd: \"Come forthe, launcelot, and prove thy mayne, Thou traytour that hast treson wroght; my thre brethern thou haste slayne And falsly theym to ground[e] brought; Whyle me lastethe myght or mayne, Thys qarell leve wyll I noght, Ne pees shall ther neuer be sayne Or thy sydes be throw sought.\" Than launcelot thoght it no thyng gode And for these wordis he was full wo; A-bove the gatis than he yode And to the kynge he sayd so: \"Syr, me rewys in my mode That gawayne is in hert so thro. Who may me wyte, for corsse on Rode, Thou&yogh;th I hym in bataylle sloo?\" Launcelot buskyd And made hym bowne, he will boldely the batayle A-byde, With helme, shelde And hauberke browne, None better in All thys world[e] wyde, With spere in hand and gonfanowne, hys noble swerd by hys syde; Oute he Rode A grete randowne, Whan he was Redy for to Ryde. Gawayne grypes a full good spere And in he glydes glad and gay; Launcelot kydde he coude of were And euyn to hym he takys the way; So stoutely they gan to-geder bere That marvayle it was, sothe to say; With dyntis sore ganne they dere And depe wondys daltyn thay. Whan it was nyghed nere-hand none, Gawayne strenghe gan to in-crese; So bitterly he hewyd hym vppon That launcelot All for-wery was; Than to hys swerd he grypes A-none, And sethe that gawayne wyll not sese, Suche A dynte he yaffe hym one That many a Ryche Rewed that resse. launcelot sterte forthe in that stownde, And sethe that gawayne will no sease, The helme that was Ryche and Rownde The noble swerd[e] rove that rease; he hyt hym A-pon the olde wounde That ouer the sadyll downe he wente And grysely gronyd vpon the ground, And there was good gawayne shent. yit gawayne swounynge there as he lay Gryped to hym bothe swerde And sheld; \"lancelot,\" he sayd, \"sothely to saye, And by hym that All thys world shall welde, Whyle me lastethe lyffe to-daye, To the me shall I neuer yeld; But do the werste that euyr thou may, I schall defend me in the felde.\" Launcelot than full styll stoode, As man that was moche of myght: \"Gawayne, me rewes in my mode, Men hald the so noble A knyght. Wenystow I were so wode Agaynste A feble man to fyght? I wyll not now, by crosse on Rode, Nor neuer yit dyd by day nor nyght. But haue good day, my lord the kynge, And All youre dou&yogh;ty knyghtis by-dene, Wendyth home and leue your werrynge, For here ye shall no worshyppe wynne. yif I wolde my knyghtis oute brynge, I hope full sone it shuld be sene, but, good lord, thynke vppon A thynge, The loue that hathe be vs by-twene.\" After was it monthes two, As frely folke it vndyr-stode, Perhaps the mark indicating n over the o has been left out. The analogy, however, of ll. 3062 ff. speaks against this . Or euer gawayne myght Ryde or go Or had fote vpon erthe to stonde, The thirde MS. iij. tyme he was full thro To do batayle with herte and hande, But than was word comen hem to That they muste home to yngland. Suche mesage was hem brought, There was no man that thought it goode; The kynge hym-selfe full sone it thought (Full moche mornyd he in hys mode That suche treson in ynglond shuld be wroght) That he moste nedys ouer the flode. They brake sege and homward sought, And After they had moche Angry mode. That fals traytour, sir mordreid\u2014 The kynges soster sone he was, And eke hys owne sonne, As I rede\u2014 There-fore men hym fo[r] steward chase\u2014 So falsely hathe he yngland ledde, Wete yow wele, with-outen lese, Hys Eme-is wyffe wolde he wedde, That many A man rewyd that rease. Festys made he, many and fele, And grete yiftys he yafe Also; They sayd with hym was Ioye and wele And in Arthurs tyme but sorow and woo; And thus gan Ryght to wronge goo; All the concelle, is noght to hele, Thus it was, with-outen moo, To hold mordred in londe with wele. False lettres he made be wroght, And causyd messangers hem to brynge, That Arthur was to grownde broght, And chese they muste A-nother kynge. All thay sayd as hem thought: \"Arthur louyd noght but warynge And suche thynge as hym-selfe soght. Ryght so he toke hys endynge.\" mordred let crye A parlement; The peple gan thedyr to come, And holly throwe there assente They made mordred kynge with crowne; At canturbery, ferre in kente, A Fourtenyght held the feste in towne, And after that to Wynchester he wente; A Ryche brydale he lette make bowne; In somyr, whan it was fayr and bryght, Hys faders wyfe than wold he wedde And hyr hold with mayne and myght, And so hyr brynge as byrd to bedde. Sche prayd hym of leue A fourtenyght\u2014 The lady was full hard be-stad\u2014 So to london sche hyr dyght, That she and hyr maydens myght be cledd. The quene, whyte as lyly floure, With knyghtis fele of her kynne, She went to london to the towre And speryd the gates And dwellyd therin. Mordred changed than hys coloure, Thedyr he went and wold not blynne; There-to he made many A shoure, But the wallys myght he neuer wynne. The Archebysshop of canterbery thedyr yode, And hys crosse by-fore hym broght. he sayd: \"syr, for cryste on Rode, What haue ye now All in your thoght? Thy faders wyffe, whether thou be wood, To wedd her now mayste thou noght. Come Arthur euyr ouer the flood, Thow mayste be bold, it wyll be boght.\" \"A nyse clerke,\" than mordred sayd, \"Trowiste thow to warne me of my wille? be hym that for vs suffred payne, These wordys shalt thou lyke full ylle! with wilde hors thou shalt be drayne And hangyd hye vpon An hylle.\" The bischoppe to fle than was fayne And suffred hym hys folyes to fulfylle; Than he hym cursyd with boke And belle, At caunterbery, ferre in kente. Sone, whan mordred herd ther-of telle, To seche the bisschoppe hathe he sent; The bysshop durste no lenger dwelle But gold And syluer he hathe hent; There was no lenger for to spelle, But to A wyldernesse he is went; The worldys wele ther he wyll for-sake, Off Ioye kepeth he neuer more, But A chapelle he lette make By-twene two hye holtys hore; There-in weryd he the clothys blake, In wode as he an ermyte ware; Often gan he wepe and wake For yngland that had suche sorowis sare. Mordred had than lyen full longe, But the towre myght he neuer wynne, With strength ne with stoure stronge, ne with none other kynnes gynne; Hys fader dred he euyr A-monge, There-fore hys bale he nylle not blynne; He went to warne hem All with wronge The kyngdome that he was crownyd inne. Forthe to dover \u00fean gan he Ryde, All the costys wele he kende; To erlys And to barons on ylk A syde Grete yiftis he gaffe And lettres send, And for-sette the see on ylke A syde With bold men And bowes bente; Fro yngland, that is brode And wyde, hys owne fader he wold deffend. Arthur, that was mykelle of myght, With hys folke come over the flode, An C galeyse that were welle dyght With barons bold And hye of blode; he wende to haue landyd, as it was Ryght, At Dower, ther hym thoght full gode, And ther he fande many An hardy knyght That styffe in stoure A-gaynste hym stode. Arthur sone hathe take the land That hym was leveste in to lende; hys fele fomen that he ther found, he wende by-fore had bene hys frend. The kynge was wrothe And weliney wode, And with hys men he gan vp wend; So strong A stoure was vpon that stronde That many A man ther had hys end. Syr gawayne armyd hym in that stounde; Allas! to longe hys hede was bare; he was seke And sore vnsond; hys woundis greuyd hym full sare; One hytte hym vpon the olde wounde With A tronchon of An ore; There is good gawayne gone to grounde, That speche spake he neuyr more. Bold men, with bowes bentte, Boldely vp in botes yode, And Ryche hauberkis they Ryve and Rente, that Throw-owte braste the Rede blode; Grounden gleyves throw hem wente; Tho games thoght theym nothynge gode; But by that strong stoure was stente, The stronge stremys Ran All on blode. Arthur was so moche of myght, Was ther none that hym with-stode; He hewyd vppon ther helmes bryght, That throw ther brestes Ran the blode; By than that endyd was the fight, The false were feld, som wer fledde To canterbery All that nyght, To warne ther master, syr mordred. Mordred than made hym bowne And boldely he wylle batayle A-byde, With helme, scheld, And hauberke browne; So All hys Rowte gan forthe Ryde; They hem mette vppon barendowne, Full erly in the morowe tyde; With gleyves grete And gonfanowne Grymly they gan to-gedyr Ryde; Arthur was of Ryche A-Raye And hornys blew lowde on hyght, And mordred comyth glad and gay, As traytour that was false in fyght. Thay faught All that longe day Tyll the nyght was nyghed nyghe; Who had it sene wele myght saye That suche A stoure neuer he syghe. Arthur than faught with hert good\u2014 A nobler knyght was neuer noon; Throw helmes in-to hede yt yoode And steryd knyghtis bothe blode And bone. mordred for wrathe was nye wode, Callyd hys folke And sayd to hem One: \"Releve yow, for crosse on Rode! Alas! thys day so sone is goone!\" Fele men lyeth on bankys bare With bryght brondys throw-owte borne; Many A doughty man dede was thar, And many A lord hys lyfe hathe lorne; mordred was full of sorowe And care; At canterbery was he vpon the morne; And Arthur All nyght he dwellyd thare, Hye frely folke lay hym by-forne. Erely on the morow tyde Arthur bad hys hornys blowe, And callyd folke on euery syde, And many A dede beryed on A rowe, In pittes that was depe And wyde; On Iche An hepe they layd hem lowe, So All that ouer gone And Ryde Som by there markys men myght knowe. Arthur went to hys dyner thane\u2014 hys frely folke hym folowed faste\u2014 But whan he fand syr gawayne In A shyppe laye dede by A maste, Or euyr he coveryd myght or mayne, An C tymes hys hert nyghe braste. . . . . . . . . . . no gap in the MS. Thay layd syr gawayne vpon A bere And to the castell they hym bare, And in A chapell A-mydde the quere That bold baron they beryed thare. Arthur than changyd All hys chere; What wondyr thoghe hys hert was sare! hys suster sone, that was hym dere, Off hym shold he here neuyr mare. Syr Arthur, he wolde no lenger A-byde; Than had he All maner of euyll Reste; He sought aye forthe the southe syde And toward walys wente he weste; At salusbury he thought to byde, At that tyme he thought was beste, And calle to hym by Whytesontyde Barons bold to batayle preste. Vnto hym came many A doughty knyght, For wyde in worlde theyse wordys sprange, That syr Arthur hade All the Ryght, And mordred warred on hym with wronge. Hydowse it was to se with syght, Arthur-is oste was brode And longe, And mordred that was mykell of myght With grete gyftes made hym stronge. Sone After the feste of the trynyte Was A batayle by-twene hem sette, That A sterne batayle ther shuld be; For no lede wold they it lette; And syr Arthur makethe game And glee For myrth that they shuld be mette; And syr mordred can to the contre, With fele folke that ferre was fette. At nyght whan Arthur was brought in bedd\u2014 He shuld haue batayle vppon the morow\u2014 In stronge sweu[en]ys he was by-stedde, That many A man that day shuld haue sorow; hym thowht he satte in gold All gledde, As he was comely kynge with crowne, vpon A whele that full wyde spredd, And All hys knyghtis to hym bowne. The whele was ferly Ryche And Rownd, In world was neuyr none halfe so hye; There-on he satte Rychely crownyd With many A besaunte broche And be; he lokyd downe vpon the grownd, A blake water ther vndyr hym he see, With dragons fele there lay vn-bownde, That no man durst hem nyghe nyee. he was wondyr ferd to falle A-monge the fendys ther that faught; The whele ouer-tornyd ther with-All And eueryche by A lymme hym caught. The kynge gan lowde crye And calle, As marred man of wytte vn-saught; hys chambyrlayns wakyd hym ther with-All And woodely oute of hys slepe he raught. All nyght gan he wake And wepe, With drery hert And sorowfull stevyn, MS. chere. And A-gaynste day he felle on slepe; A-boute hym was sette tapers sevyn; Hym thought Syr gawayne hym dyd kepe With mo folke \u00fean men can nevyn, By A Ryuer that was brode And depe; All semyd Angellys cam from heuyn. The kynge was neuyr yit so fayne, hys soster sone whan that he sye; \"Welcome,\" he sayd, \"syr gawayne; And thou myght leue, welle were me. Now, leue frend, with-outen layne, What Ar tho folke that folow the?\" \"Sertis, syr,\" he sayd A-gayne, \"They byde in blysse ther I motte be. lordys they were And ladyes hende, Thys worldys lyffe that hanne for-lorne; Whyle I was man on lyffe to lende, A-gaynste her fone I faught hem forne; now fynde I them my moste Frende: They blysse the tyme that I was borne; They Asked leve with me to wende To mete with yow vpon thys morne. A monthe day of trewse moste ye take And than to batayle be ye bayne; yow comethe to helpe lancelot du lake, With many A man mykell of mayne: To-morne the batayle ye moste for-sake Or ellys, certis, ye shall be slayne.\" The kynge gan woffully wepe and wake, And sayd: \"Allas! thys Rewffull Rayne!\" hastely hys clothys on hym he dyde, And to hys lordys gan he saye: \"In stronge sweyneys I haue bene stad, That glad I may not for no gamys gaye. We muste vnto syr mordred sende And founde to take An-other day, Or trewly thys day I mon be shende, Thys know I in bed as I laye. Goo thow, syr lucan de boteler, That wyse wordys haste in wolde, And loke that thou take with the here Bysshopys fele and barons bolde.\" Forthe went they All in fere, in trew bokys as it is tolde, To syr mordred and hys lordis there they were, And an C knyghtis All vn-tolde. The knyghtis that ware of grete valoure, By-fore syr mordred as they stode, They gretyn hym with grete honowre, As barons bold And hye of blode: \"Ryght wele the gretys kynge Arthur, And praythe the with mylde mode, A monethe day to stynte thys stoure, For hys loue that dyed on Rode.\" mordred, that was bothe kene And bolde, made hym breme As Any bore at bay, And sware by Iudas that Ihesus Ihc. in MS., i. e. Jesus Christ. sold: \"Suche sawes Ar not now to saye; That he hathe hyght he shall it hold; The tone of vs shall dye thys day; And telle hym trewly that I tolde, I schall hym marre, yife that I may.\" \"Syr, thay sayd, with-owten lese, Thow&yogh; thou And he to batayle bowne, many A ryche shall rewe that reasse, By All by dalte vpon thys downe; yit were it better for to sease, And lette [hym] be kynge and bere the crowne; And after hys dayes, full dredelesse, ye to welde All yngland, towre And towne.\" mordred tho stode stylle A whyle, And wrothely vp hys eyne there wente, And sayd: \"wyste I it were hys wylle To yeue me cornwale And kente, lette vs mete vpon yonder hylle And talke to-gedyr with gode entente; Suche forwardys to full-fylle, There-to shall I me sone Assent. And yiffe we may with spechys spede, With trew trowthes of entayle, hold the bode-worde that we bede, To yeue me kente And cornwayle, Trew loue shall ther lenge And lende; And, sertis, forwardys yif we fayle, Aythur to sterte vppon A stede, styffely for to do batayle.\" \"Sur, wyll ye come in suche maner, With xij knyghtis or fourtene, Or ellys All your strenghe in fere, With helmes bryght And hauberkys shene?\" \"Se[r]tys, nay,\" than sayd he thore, \"Othur warke thou thare not wene, But bothe oure hoostis shall nyghe nere And we shalle talke them by-twene.\" They toke ther leue, with-owten lese, And wyghtely vpon there way wente; To kynge Arthur the way they chese, there that he satte with-in hys tente. \"Syr, we haue proferyd pease, Yiffe ye wille ther-to Assente: Gyffe hym the crowne After your dayes And in yower lyffe cornwayle and kente; To hys by-heste yiffe ye will holde, And your trouthe trewly ther-to plyght, maketh All redy your men bolde, With helme, swerd And hauberke bryght; ye schall mete vppon yone molde That ayther oste may se with syght; And yiff your foreward fayle to holde, Jhu merc at top of leaf 126, back. There is no bote but for to fyght.\" But whan Arthur herd thys nevyn, Trewly ther-to he hathe sworne, And Arayed hym with batayles seuyn, With brode baners by-fore hym borne; They lemyd lyght As Any leuyn MS. lemyn. Whan they shold mete vpon the morne. There lyves no man vndyr heuyn A feyrer syght hath sene by-forne. But mordred many men had mo; So mordred that was mykell of mayne, he had euyr xij A-gaynste hym two Off barons bold to batayle bayne. Arthur And mordred\u2014bothe were thro\u2014 Shuld mete bothe vpon A playne; The wyse shuld come to And fro To make A-cord, the sothe to sayne. Arthur in hys herte hathe Caste And to hys lordis gan he saye: \"To yonder traytour haue I no truste But that he woll vs falselly be-traye, yiff we may not oure forwardys faste. And ye se any wepyn drayne, presythe forthe As princes praste, That he & All hys hoste be slayne.\" mordred, that was kene And thro, hys frely folke he sayd to-forne: \"I wote that Arthur is full woo That he hathe thus hys landys lorne; With fourtene knyghtis And no mo shall we mete at yondyr thorne; yiff Any treason by-twene vs go, That brode baners forth be borne.\" Arthur with knyghtis fully xiiij, To that thorne on fote they fonde, With helme, sheld, And hauberke shene; Ryght so they trotted vppon \u00fee grownde. But As they A-cordyd shulde haue bene, An Edder glode forth vpon the grownde; he stange A knyght, that men myght sene That he was seke And full vn-sownde. Owte he brayed with a swerd bryght; To kylle the Adder had he thogh[t]e; Whan Arthur party saw that syght, Frely they to-gedyr sought; There was no-thynge with-stande theym myght; They wend that treson had bene wroghte. That day dyed many A doughty knyght, And many A bolde man was broght to noght. Arthur stert vpon hys stede; he saw no thyng hym with-stand myght; mordred owte of wytte nere yede, And wrothely in-to hys sadyll he lyght; Off A-corde was no-thyng to bede, But fewtred sperys and to-geder sprente; Full many A doughty man of dede Sone there was leyde vpon the bente. mordred I-maryd many A man, And boldely he gan hys batayle abyde; So sternely oute hys stede Ranne, many A rowte he gan throw Ryde; Arthur of batayle neuyr blanne To dele woundys wykke and wyde; Fro the morow that it by-ganne Tylle it was nere the nyghtis tyde, There was many A spere spente, And many A thro word they spake; many A bronde was bowyd and bente And many A knyghtis helme they brake; Ryche helmes they Roffe and rente; The Ryche rowtes gan to-gedyr Rayke, An MS. And. C thousand vpon the bente; The boldest or evyn was made Ryght meke. Sythe bretayne owte of troy was sought And made in bretayne hys owne wonne, Suche wondrys neuyr ere was wroght, Neuyr yit vnder the sonne; By evyn leuyd was there noght That euyr steryd with blode or bone But Arthur and ij that he thedyr broghte, And mordred was levyd there Alone. The tone was lucan de botelere, That bled at many A bale-full wound, And hys brodyr, syr bedwere, Was sely seke and sore vnsounde. Than spake Arthur these wordys there: \"Shall we not brynge thys theffe to ground?\" A spere he gryped with fell chere, And felly they gan to-gedyr found. he hytte mordred amydde the breste And oute At the bakke bone hym bare; There hathe mordred hys lyffe loste, That speche spake he neuyr mare; But kenely vp hys Arme he caste And yaff Arthur A wound sare, In-to the hede throw the helme And creste, That iij tymes he swownyd thare. Syr lucan And syr Bedwere By-twene theym two the kynge vp-held; So forthe went tho iij in fere, And All were slayne that lay in feld. The doughty kynge that was hem dere, For sore myght not hym-self weld; To A chapelle they went in fere\u2014 Off bote they saw no better beld. All nyght thay in the chapelle laye, Be the see syde, As I yow newyn, To mary mercy cryand aye, With drery herte and sorowfull stevyn; And to hyr leue sonne gan they pray: \"Ihesu, for thy namys sevyn, Wis hys sowle the Ryght way, That he lese not the blysse of heuyn.\" As syr lucan de boleter stode, he sey folk vppon playnes hye; Bold barons of bone and blode, They Refte MS. Reste. theym besaunt, broche, and bee; And to the kynge Agayne thay yode, Hym to warne with wordys slee; no gap in the MS. To the kynge spake he full styll, Rewffully as he myght than Rowne: \"Sir, I haue bene At yone hylle, There fele folke drawen to the downe; I note whedyr they wyll vs good or ylle, I rede we buske And make vs bowne, yiff it be your worthy wylle, That we wende to som towne.\" \"Now, syr lucan, As thow Radde, lyfte me vp, whyle that I may laste.\" Bothe hys Armes on hym he sprad With All hys strengh to hold hym faste. The kynge was wondyd and for-bled And swownyng on hym hys eyne he caste; Syr lucan was hard by-stadde; He held the kynge to hys owne herte braste. Whan the kynge had swounyd there, By an Auter vp he stode; Syr lucan, that was hym dere, Lay dede and fomyd in the blode. Hys bold brothyr, Sir Bedwere, Full mykell mornyd in hys mode; For sorow he my&yogh;te not nyghe hym nere, But euyr wepyd As he were wode. The kynge tornyd hym there he stode, To syr Bedwere with wordys kene: \"Have Excalaber, my swerd[e] good; A better brond was neuyr sene; Go, Caste it in the salt flode And thou shalt se wonder, as I wene. hye the faste, for crosse on Rode, And telle me what thou haste ther sene.\" The knyght was both hende and free, To save that swerd he was full glad, And thought \"whethyr I better bee, yif neuyr man it After had; And I it caste in-to the see, Off mold was neuyr man so mad.\" The swerd he hyd vndyr A tree, And sayd: \"syr, I ded as ye me bad.\" \"What saw thow there?\" than sayd the kynge, \"Telle me now, yif thow can.\" \"Sertes, syr,\" he sayd, \"nothynge But watres depe And wawes wanne.\" \"A! now thou haste broke my byddynge! Why haste thou do so, thow false man? A-nother bode thou muste me brynge.\" Thanne careffully the knyght forthe Ranne And thought the swerd yit he wold hyde, And keste the scauberke in the flode. \"yif Any Aventurs shall be-tyde, There-by shall I se tokenys good.\" In-to the see he lette the scauberke glyde; A whyle on the land hee there stode, Than to the kynge he wente that tyde, And sayd: \"syr, it is done, by the Rode.\" \"Saw thou Any wondres more?\" \"Sertys, syr, I saw nought.\" \"A! false traytor,\" he sayd thore, \"Twyse thou haste me treson wroght; That shall thou rew sely sore; And, be thou bold, it shal be bought.\" The knyght than cryed: \"lord, thyn ore!\" And to the swerd sone he sought. Syr bedwere saw that bote was beste, And to the good swerd he wente; In-to the see he hyt keste; Than myght he se what that it mente. There cam An hand with-outen Reste Oute of the water And feyre it hente, And brandysshyd As it shuld braste, And sythe, as gleme, A-way it glente. To the kynge A-gayne wente he thare, And sayd: \"leve syr, I saw An hand; Oute of the water it cam All bare, And thryse brandysshyd that Ryche brande.\" \"helpe me sone that I ware there.\" he lede hys lord vnto that stronde; A ryche shyppe, with maste And ore, Full of ladyes, there they fonde. The ladyes, that were feyre and free, Curteysly the kynge gan they fonge, And one that bryghtest was of blee wepyd sore and handys wrange. \"Broder,\" she sayd, \"wo ys me! Fro lechyng hastow be to longe. I wote that gretely greuyth me, For thy paynes Ar full stronge.\" The knyght kest A rewfull rowne, There he stode, sore and vnsownde, And say[de]: \"lord, whedyr Ar ye bowne? Allas! whedyr wyll ye fro me fownde?\" The kynge spake with A sory sowne: \"I wylle wende a lytell stownde In-to the vale of Avelovne, A whyle to hele me of my wounde.\" Whan the shyppe from the land was broght, Syr bedwere saw of hem no more; Throw the forest forthe he soughte, On hyllys and holtys hore. Of hys lyffe Rought he Ryght noght, All nyght he went wepynge sore; A-gaynste the day he fownde ther wrought A chapelle by-twene ij holtes hore. To the chapell he toke the way; There myght he se A woundyr syght; Than saw he where an ermyte laye By-fore A tombe that new was dyghte; And coveryd it was with marboll graye And with Ryche lettres Rayled Aryght; There-on An herse, sothely to saye, With an C tappers lyghte. vnto the ermyte wente he thare And Askyd who was beryed there. The ermyte Answeryd swythe yare: \"There-of can I tell no more. A-bowte mydnyght were ladyes here, In world ne wyste I what they were; Thys body they broght vppon a bere And beryed it with woundys sore; Besavntis offred they here bryght, I hope an C povnd and more, And bad me pray bothe day and nyght For hym that is buryed in these moldys hore Vnto ower lady bothe day And nyght, That she hys sowle helpe sholde.\" The knyght redde the lettres A-ryght; For sorow he fell vn-to the folde. \"Ermyte,\" he sayd, \"with-oute lesynge, here lyeth my lord that I haue lorne, Bold arthur, the beste kynge That euyr was in bretayne borne. yif me som of thy clothynge, For hym that bare the crowne of thorne, And leue that I may with the lenge, Whyle I may leve, And pray hym forne.\" The holy ermyte wold not wounde\u2014 Some tyme Archebishop he was, That mordred flemyd oute of londe, And in the wode hys wonnyng chase\u2014 he thankyd Ihesu All of his sound That syr bedwere was comyn in pease; he resayved hym with herte And honde, To-gedyr to dwelle, with-outen lese. Whan quene Gaynor, the kynges wyffe, Wyste that All was gone to wrake, A-way she went with ladys fyve To Avmysbery, A nonne hyr for to make. Ther-in she lyved An holy lyffe, In prayers for to wepe And wake; neuyr After she cowde be blythe; There weryd she clothys whyte And blake. Whan thys tydyngis was to launcelot broght, What wondyr thowgh hys hert were sore! hys men, hys frendys, to hym sought And All the wyse that with hym were. her gallayes were All Redy wroght, They buskyd theyme And made yare; To helpe Arthur was ther thoght And make mordred of blysse full bare. lancelot had crownyd kyngis sevyn, Erlys fele And barons bold; The nombyr of knyghtis I can not nevyn, The squyres to fele to be told; They lemyd lyght as Any levyn MS. leme. The wynde was as hem-self wold, Throw the grace of god of hevyn; At douer they toke hauyn And hold; There herd telle lancelot in that towne, In lond it is not for to layne, how they had faught at barendowne, And how beryed was syr gawayne, And how mordred wold be kynge with crowne, And how ayther of theym had other slayn, And All that were to batayle bowne At salysbery lay dede vpon the playne; Also in londe herd hyt kythe, That made hys hert wonder sare, quene Gaynour, the kyngis wyffe, Myche had levyd in sorow and care; A-way she went with ladyes fyve, In lond they wyste not whedyr whar, Dolwyn dede or to be on lyve; That made hys mornyng moche the mare. lancelot clepid hys kyngis with crowne, Syr bors stode hym nere be-syde; he sayd: \"lordyngis, I wyll wend to-forne, And by these bankys ye shall A-byde Vnto fyftene dayes at the morne. In lond what so euyr vs be-tyde, To herkyn what lord hys lyffe hathe lorne, loke ye Rappe yow not vp to Ryde.\" There had he nouther Roo ne Reste, But forthe he went with drery mode, And iij dayes he went euyn weste, As man that cowde nother yvell nor good; Than syghe he where A towre by weste Was byggyd by A burnys flode; There he hopyd it were beste For to gete hym som lyves stode.

With that they gan departe in twene, But none erthely man covde telle The sorow that there by-gan to bene; Wryngyng ther handis and lowde they yelle, As they neuyr more shuld blynne, And sythe in swonne bothe downe they felle; Who saw that sorow euyr myght it mene. But ladyes than with mornyng chere, In-to the chambyr the quene they bare, And All full besy made theym there To cover the quene of hyr care. many Also that with lancelot were, They comforte hym w[ith] rewfull care; Whan he was coveryd, he toke hys gere And went frome thense with-outen mare; hys hert was hevy As Any lede, And leuer he was hys lyffe haue lorne; he sayd: \"Ryghtwosse god! what is my Rede? Allas! for-bare, why was I borne?\" A-way he went, as he had fled, To A foreste that was hym by-forne; hys lyffe fayne he wold haue leuyd; hys Ryche A-tyre he wold haue of-torne. All nyght gan he wepe And wrynge And went A-boute As he were wode; Erely, As the day gan sprynge, Tho syghe he where A chapell stode; A belle herd he rewfully Rynge; he hyed hym than And thedyr yode; A preste was Redy for to synge, And masse he herd with drery mode. The Arshebysshoppe was ermyte thare, That flemyd was for hys werkys trew; The masse he sange with syghyng sare, And ofte he changyd hyde and hewe; Syr bedwere had sorow And care And ofte mornyd for tho werkys newe; Aftyr masse was morny[n]ge mare, Whan Iche of hem othyr knewe. Whan the sorow was to the ende, The byshope toke hys obbyte thare, And welcomyd launcelot as the hend, And on hys knees downe gan he fare: \"Syr, ye be welcome as oure frende Vnto thys byggying in bankys bare; Were it yower wyll with vs to lende Thys one nyght, yif ye may [no] mare!\" Whan they hym knew at the laste, Feyre in Armys they gan hym folde, And sythe he askyd frely faste Off Arthur And of other bolde; An C tymes hys hert ne[re] braste, Whyle syr Bedwere the tale told. To Arthur-is tombe he caste, Hys carefull corage wexid All cold; He threw hys armys to the walle, That Ryche were and bryght of blee; By-fore the e[r]myte he gan downe falle, And comely knelyd vpon hys knee; Than he shrove hym of hys synnes Alle And prayd he myght hys broder be, To serue god in boure and halle, That myght-full kynge of mercy free. That holy bisshope nold not blynne, But blythe was to do hys boone; He resseyuyd hym with wele and wynne And thankyd Ihesu trew in trone, And shroffe hym ther of hys synne, As clene as he had neuyr done none; And sythe he kyste hym cheke and chynne And an Abbyte there dyd hym vpon. hys grete hooste at dover laye, And wende he shuld have comyn A-gayne, Tylle After by-felle vpon A day, Syr lyonell, that was mekyll of mayne, With fyffty lordys, the sothe to saye, To seche hys lord he was full fayne; To london he toke the Ryght way; Alas for woo! there was he slayne. Bors De gawnes wold no lenger Abyde, But buskyd hym And made All bowne, And bad All the oste homeward Ryde\u2014 God send theym wynd and wedyr Rownd\u2014 To seke lancelot wyll he Ryde. Ector and eche dywerse wayes yode, And bors sowght forthe the weste syde, As he that cowde nowther yvell nor gode. Full Erly in A morow tyde In A foreste he fownd A welle; he Rode euyr forthe by the Ryver syde, Tyll he had syght of A chapelle; There at masse thought he A-byde; Rewfully he herd A belle Rynge; Ther lancelot he fand with mekelle pryde And prayd he myght with hym there dwelle. Or the halfe yere were comen to the ende, There was comyn of there felowse sevyn, Where ychone had sought there frend, With sorowfull herte And drery stevyn; had neuyr none wyll A-way to wend, Whan they herd of launcelot nevyn, But All to-gedyr there gan they lend, As it was goddys wyll of heuyn. holyche All tho sevyn yerys lancelot was preste and masse songe; In penance and in dyverse prayers That lyffe hym thought no-thyng longe; Syr bors And hys other ferys On bokys Redde and bellys Ronge; So lytell they wexe of lyn And lerys, Theym to know it was stronge. hytte felle A-gayne an euyn-tyde That launcelot sekenyd sely sare; The bysshop he clepyd to his syde And All hys felaws lesse and mare; he sayd: \"bretherne, I may no lenger A-byde, my baleffull blode of lyffe is bare; What bote is it to hele And hyde? my fowle flesshe will to erthe fare. but, bretherne, I pray yow to-nyght, To-morow, whan ye fynde me dede, vpon A bere that ye wyll me dyght And to Ioyes garde than me lede; For the loue of god All-myght, Bery my body in that stede; Some tyme my trowthe ther-to I plyght, Allas! me for-thynketh that I so dyd.\" \"mercy, syr ,\" they Sayd All three, \"for hys loue that dyed on Rode, yif Any yvell haue greuyd the, hyt ys bot hevynesse of yower blode; To-morow ye shall better be. Whan were ye but of comforte gode?\" merely spake All men but he, But streyght vnto hys bed he yode, And clepyd the bysshope hym vntylle, And shrove hym of hys synnes clene, Off All hys synnes loude and stylle, And of hys synnes myche dyd he mene; Ther he Resseyved with good wylle God, mary-is sonne, mayden clene. Than bors of wepyng had neuyr hys fylle; To bedde they yede than All by-dene. A lytell whyle by-fore the day, As the bysshop lay in hys bed, A laughter toke hym there he laye, That All they were Ryght sore A-dred. They wakenyd hym, for sothe to saye, And Askyd yif he were hard by-sted. he sayd: \"Allas And wele A-way! Why ne had I lenger thus be ledd? Allas! why nyghed ye me nye, To A-wake me in word or stevyn ? here was launcelot bryght of blee With Angellis xxx thousand and sevyn; hym they bare vp on hye; A-gaynste hym openyd the gatys of hevyn; Suche A syght Ryght now I see, Is none in erthe that myght it nevyn.\" \"Syr,\" thay sayd, \"for crosse on Rode, Dothe suche wordys clene A-way. Syr lancelot eylythe no-thynge but gode; he shall be hole by pryme of day.\" Candell they lyght And to hym yode, And fownde hym dede, for sothe to saye, Rede and fayer of flesshe and blode, Ryght As he in slepynge laye. \"Allas! syr bors, that I was borne! That euyr I shuld see thys in dede! The beste knyght hys lyffe hathe lorne That euyr in stoure by-strode A stede. Ihesu that crownyd was with thorne, In heuyn hys soule foster and fede!\" In the MS. this line follows l. 3897. Vnto the fyfty day at the morne They lefte not for to synge And Rede, And After they made theym A bere, The bysshop and these other bold, And forthe they wente, All in fere To Ioyes garde, that Ryche hold. In A chapell a-myddys the quere A graue they made as thay wold, And iij dayes they wakyd hym there, In the castell with carys cold. Ryght as they stode A-boute the bere And to bereynge hym shold haue browght, In cam syr Ector, hys brodyr dere, That vij yere A-fore had hym sought. he lokyd vp in-to the quere; To here A masse than had he thought; For that they All Ravysshyd were, They knew hym and he hem nought. Syr bors bothe wepte And songe, Whan they that feyre faste vnfold; There was none but hys handys wrange, The bysshop nor none of the other bold. Syr Ector than thought longe; What thys corps was feyne wete he wolde; An C tymes hys herte nye sprange, By that bors had hym the tale tolde. Full hendely syr bors to hym spakke And sayd: \"welcome, syr Ector, I-wysse; here lyethe my lord lancelot du lake, for whome that we haue mornyd thus.\" Than In Armys they gan hym take, The dede body to clyppe And kysse, And prayed All nyght he myght hym wake, For Ihesu love, kynge of blysse. Syr Ector of hys wytte nere wente, Walowed and wronge as he were wode; So wofully hys mone he mente, hys sorow myngyd All hys mode; Whan the corps in Armys he hente, The terys owte of hys yen yode; went was written before yode and then struck out . At the laste they myght no lenger stent, But beryed hym with drery mode. Sythen on there knees they knelyd downe\u2014 Grete sorow it was to se with syght\u2014 \"Vnto Ihesu cryste Aske I A boone, And to hys moder, mary bryght. lord, As thow madyste bothe sonne and mone, And god And man arte moste of myght, Brynge thys sowle vnto thy trone, And euyr thow Rewdyste on gentyll knyght.\" Syr Ector tent not to hys stede, Whedyr he wold stynt or Renne Away, But with theym to dwelle and lede, For lancelot All hys lyffe to pray. On hym dyd he armytes wede, And to hyr chapell went hyr way; A fourtenyght on fote they yede, Or they home come, for sothe to say. Whan they came to Avmysbery, Dede they faunde Gaynour the quene, With Roddys feyre and Rede as chery; And forthe they bare hyr theym by-twene, And beryed hyr with masse full merry By syr Arthur, as I yow mene. Now hyght there chapell glassynbery, An Abbay full Ryche, of order clene. Off lancelot du lake telle I no more, But thus by-leve these ermytes sevyn; And yit is Arthur beryed thore, And quene Gaynour, as I yow nevyn; With monkes that ar Ryght of lore. They Rede and synge with mylde stevyn: \"Ihesu, that suffred woundes sore, Graunt vs All the blysse of hevyn!\" Amen. Explycit le morte Arthur.
